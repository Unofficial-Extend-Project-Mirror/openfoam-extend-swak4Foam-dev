* Overview
  This document gives an overview on the compatibility of the examples
  with a some OF-versions.

  /Compatibility/ means that the cases run in this Foam-version, that
  the =swak4Foam=-parts work but not necessarily that the results are
  correct
** Used Foam-versions
   Currently these Foam-versions are in the matrix (these are the
   names in the column titles):
   - 4.0 Fnd :: The OpenFOAM 4.0 Foundation release
   - 4.0 Ext :: The Foam-Extend 4.0 release
   - 1606+ :: The OpenFOAM 1606+ release
   - 2.3 :: The OpenFOAM 2.3 release (this is the oldes release
        tested)
** Symbols in the tables
   - \checkmark :: this means that the case was tested and runs. Not
        necessarily till the end
   - \sad :: means that the case was tested and does not run
   - \smiley :: test runs and gives correct results
   - \dagger :: This test will never run on this Foam version because
        of technical constraints (missing solver etc)
   - no symbol :: This means that the case was not yet tested on this version
