#+TITLE: The /incomplete/ =swak4Foam= reference
#+AUTHOR: Bernhard F.W. Gschaider

* Introduction
  This document gives an overview of the usage of =swak4Foam=. It
  explains the common paramters, expressions and usable parts. It is
  not intended as an introduction to =swak4Foam= (for that have a look
  at
  http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/File:Swak4Foam_PSU2011_presentation.pdf).

  The structure of the document is
  - the first part gives an overview of the parsers. The parser is the
    part that reads expressions entered by the user and interprets
    them. These parsers are central to =swak4Foam= and this chapter
    explains
    - the expressions
    - common settings and concepts
    - order of evaluations
  - the next part describes the parts of =swak4foam= that are directly
    usable. This means
    - the utilities (including the popular =funkySetFields=)
    - boundary conditions (including =groovyBC=)
    - the collection of function objects
    - and the function plugins that can extend the parsers
  - the last part gives a short descrition on how to use functionality
    of =swak4foam= in your own programs

   text-editor as all the indentations etc have special meaning.

* The parsers (expression grammar)
  The central concept in =swak4Foam= is the /parser/. A parser reads a
  string with an expression, interprets it according to a grammar and
  then evaluates the grammar yielding a result.

  In principle each parser is composed of three elements pictured in
  figure \ref{fig:driverLexerParser}:
  - the =Lexer= which reads the tokens from the string (the lexers are
    generated by =flex= from a special description file)
  - the =GrammarParser= which gets the token from the =lexer= and
    interprets them according to a specified grammer (the grammar
    specification is turned into a program by =bison=)
  - the =Driver= is the part of the parser that is "seen" by the
    calling program. It
    - starts the grammar parser and the lexer
    - assists them in decisions like "is this symbol a variable?"
    - collects the results
    - implements concrete data generation actions (like reading
      fields, getting cell centers, etc)
  In the following texts the term /Parser/ will refer to this complex
  of three entities
