State: fixed
Subject: Allow xx, xy etc as field names
Message-Id: <c7e7131ed2c69f4b-0-artemis@bgs-Greybook.local>

As the lexer now converts 'xx' into a token to allow the access of
idividual elements of tensors these names are not available as
fields. Modify the lexers so that a '.' triggers a conditional lexer
state and 'xx' and friends are only accepted for the next token
