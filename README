* Description
  A collection of libraries and tools that let the user handle
  OpenFOAM-data based on expressions

** Documentation
   See: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/contrib/swak4Foam
* Installation/Compilation
** Requirements
   - Version 1.7 of OpenFOAM (1.6 should work, too)
   - the compiler generators =bison= and =flex=
   - =simpleSwakFunctionObjects= needs the =simpleFunctionObjects=
     (see
     http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_simpleFunctionObjects)
     all other functionality has no additional requirements
     (=simpleSwakFunctionObjects= is only required by some examples)
** Building
  =wmake all= at the base directory should build all the libraries and
  tools.

  The main library =swak4FoamParsers= can't be built in parallel (no
  values of =WM_NCOMPPROCS= bigger than 1)
* Contents
** Libraries
   Collection of Libraries
*** =swak4FoamParsers=
    The basis of =swak4Foam=: the expression parsers with the logic to
    access the /OpenFOAM/ data-structures.

    None of the other software pieces compile without it
*** =groovyBC=
    Implements the infamous =groovyBC=. A boundary condition that
    allows arbitrary expressions in the field-file
*** =swakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects that have no additional requirements. Mainly used
    for manipulating and creating fields with expressions
*** =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects based on the =simpleFunctionObjects=-library
    (which is a prerequisite for compiling it).

    Evaluate expressions and output the results
*** =swakSourceFields=
    Field that is calculated from an expression. To be used as
    source-term or coefficient in some solver
*** =swakTopoSources=
    =topoSources= for =cellSet= and =faceSet=. Can be used with the
    =cellSet= and =faceSet=-utilities 
** Utilities
*** =funkySetFields=
    Utility that allows creation and manipulation of files with
    expressions 
*** =funkySetBoundaryField=
    Sets any field on a boundary to a non-uniform value based on an
    expression. 

    Acts without deeper understanding of the underlying boundary condition
*** =replayTransientBC=
    Utility to quickly test whether a groovyBC gives the expected
    results. Writes the specified fields with the applied boundary
    condition but doesn't do anything else.

    Can be used for other BCs as well
** Examples
   If not otherwise noted cases are prepared by a simple
   =blockMesh=-call.

   *All the cases here are strictly for demonstration purposes and
    resemble nothing from the 'real world'*
*** groovyBC
    The old =groovyBC=-Demos
**** pulsedPitzDaily
    - Solver :: pisoFoam
    - Also demonstrates :: =manipulateField=, =expressionField= and
         =clearField= from the
         =swakFunctionObjects=. =patchExpression= from
         =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=. 
**** wobbler
    - Solver :: solidDisplacementFoam
**** circulatingSplash 
    - Solver :: interDyMFoam 
    - Remark :: this one crashes halfway through the calculation. If
                you can fix it: Be my guest
**** movingConeDistorted
    - Solver :: pimpleDyMFoam
**** average-t-junction
    - Solver :: pimpleFoam
**** multiRegionHeaterFeedback
    - Solver :: chtMultiRegionFoam
    - Mesh preparation :: Execute the script =prepare.sh= in that
         directory 
    - Also demonstrated :: =patchExpression= and =swakExpression= from
         =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=. 
*** FunkySetFields
    Example dictionary for =funkySetFields=
*** FunkySetBoundaryFields
    Example dictionary for =funkySetBoundaryFields=. Sets nonsense
    boundary conditions for the world famous =damBreak=-case
*** InterFoamWithSources
    Demonstrates usage of =swakSourceFields=
**** =interFoamWithSources=
     Slightly modified version of =interFoam=. Adds a source term to
     the momentum equation. The source term is an expression that is
     defined at run-time
**** =mixingThing=
     Demonstration case for it.
     - Preparation :: Run the script =prepare.sh= to prepare the case
*** other
    Cases that don't have a =groovyBC=
**** =angledDuctImplicit=
     - Solver :: rhoPorousSimpleFoam
     - Mesh preparation :: Execute the =makeMesh.sh=-script in that
          directory. If you want to run in parallel call the
          =decomposeMesh.sh=-script with the number of processors as
          an argument
     - Demonstrates :: Usage of the =swakTopoSources=. Compares
          different approaches to evaluating with the
          =swakExpression=-functionObject
