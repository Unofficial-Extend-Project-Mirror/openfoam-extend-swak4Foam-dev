#+TITLE: =README= for =swak4Foam= - Version for OpenFOAM 2.x
#+OPTIONS: H:4 toc:nil
* Description
  A collection of libraries and tools that let the user handle
  OpenFOAM-data based on expressions
* About this document
** Scope
   This file gives an overview of =swak4Foam= and a history of the
   features. It is not a canonical documentation.
** Technical
   This file is written in the mighty =org-mode= (see
   [[http://orgmode.org/]]) a markup/outline-mode for (X)Emacs. Using this
   mode it can be easily (using 3 keystrokes ... it's Emacs) to PDF or
   HTML to make it more readable (and add a table of contents).

   Please don't try to "beautify" it with any other text editor as
   this will surly mess up the markup (and keeping the file
   /org-compatible/ outside of the =org-mode= is a pain in the neck.

   The Markdown-variant =README.md= is only there to be displayed in a
   human-readable form by the web-interface to =mercurial= at
   =sourceforge.net=. It is generated from =REAME= and only updated
   during releases. *Don't edit it*.

** Documentation
   See: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/contrib/swak4Foam
* Installation/Compilation
** Requirements
   - Version 2.0 or higher of OpenFOAM and version 3.0 or higher of
     Foam.  The =OpenFOAM-dev= is also supported but because this is
     frequently changing compilation may fail. The branch
     =feature/port_of-dev= of the development repository *may* work
     better
   - the compiler generators =bison= and =flex=
     - bison :: =swak4Foam= is known to work with =bison= version 2.4 and
                higher. Version 2.3 compiles but the plugin-functionality does
                not work correctly.
                Version 3.0 does *not* work
     - flex :: since the introduction of the plugin functions at least
               a flex version of =2.5.33= is required (=2.5.35= is the
               lowest *confirmed* version)

   Both of these are mainstream packages (they are for instance needed
   to compile =gcc=) and should exist on every Linux distribution. Use
   the package manager of your distribution to install them and *only*
   if the compilation process of =swak4Foam= complains about too low
   or too high versions compile special version. This can be easily
   done by calling
: ./maintainanceScripts/compileRequirements.sh
   in the directory of the sources. This will download a fitting
   =bison= version, compile it and install it in such a way that it is
   *only* used during the compilation of =swak4Foam=.

   =swak4Foam= tries to keep the requirements on these as low as
   possible and sometimes lower versions than the ones reported *may*
   work. If they do please report so.

   The version of bison can be checked with
: bison -V
   The version of flex with
: flex -V
** Building
: wmake all
   at the base directory should build all the libraries and
   tools.

   Rerun the command to make sure that there was no problem with the
   compilation (this should be quite fast and only report libraries
   being created and some administrative stuff)
*** Additional configuration
    Some features (currently only the =Python=-integration may need
    third party software. The paths to these packages can be
    configured in a file =swakConfiguration= (an example file
    =swakConfiguration.example= is provided. There is also a file
    =swakConfiguration.automatic= that tries to automatically
    determine the location of Python. It does not work on all systems
    and therefor is not enabled by default). If that file is not
    present these unconfigured features will not be compiled.

    Environment variables that can be set in this file are:
    - SWAK_PYTHON_INCLUDE :: Path to the =Python.h= file of the used
         =python=-installation
    - SWAK_PYTHON_LINK :: Options to link the =python=-library to the
         library for the =python=-integration
    - SWAK_USER_PLUGINS :: A list of paths separated by
         semicolons. These are the directories of libraries with
         function-plugins. They are compiled in the course of the
         normal =swak=-compilation. This makes sure that they are
         consistent with the =swak=-release in the case of an update
    - SWAK_COMPILE_GRAMMAR_OPTION :: Additional compiler switches for
         the C-files generated by =bison=. Usually used if the default
         optimization switches are too aggressive and compilation
         takes to long (then a value like =-O0= would for instance
         switch off all optimizations)
    - SWAK_COMPILE_LEXER_OPTION :: Additional compiler switches for
         files generated by =flex=. For some compilers (Intel)
         aggressive optimization when compiling these files may cause
         uninitialized memory and crashes. This variable can be used
         to switch off the optimization (usually this fixes the
         problems)
    - SWAK_TEST_RACE_CONDITIONS :: Meant to be used only by developers,
         for performing a verification on whether race conditions occur
         during parallel compilation, regarding the grammar parsers.
*** Possible compilation failure with old 2.0.x-versions
    With older versions of 2.0.x (or 2.0 or 2.0.1) it is possible that
    the compilation of  =swakCodedFunctionObject= will fail. In that
    case remove the last parameter to the
    =codedFunctionObject=-constructor in =swakCodedFunctionObject.C=
    (it is clearly marked by a comment)
*** Special versions of the python integration
    *Note*: This section is very special and won't be needed by most
    people

    The library =libswakPythonIntegration.so= links against a specific
    version of the python library. In certain circumstances (for
    instance the OS of the cluster is different from the one that swak
    was compiled on) this python-version is not available on the
    target machine. While all other parts of swak will work the
    python-integration won't load on the target machine. To fix this
    problem a workaround is provided:

    The script =maintainanceScripts/makeSpecialPythonLibrary.sh=
    compiles a special version of the =libswakPythonIntegration.so=
    that is identified by an additional suffix (for instance the
    suffix =Cluster= makes a file
    =libswakPythonIntegrationCluster.so=). That script has to be run
    *on the target system* and needs 3 parameters:
    1. =SWAK_PYTHON_INCLUDE=
    2. =SWAK_PYTHON_LINK=
    3. The suffix
    For instance
: ./maintainanceScripts/makeSpecialPythonLibrary.sh -I/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/include/python2.5 "-L/opt/local/lib -lpython2.5" Version2.5
    compiles a version for an old python.

    To enable the python-integration in =libs= in =controlDict= *both*
    python-integrations have to be specified. One of them will fail on
    each machine (because the required python-library is not there),
    the other one will provide the python-functionObjects.

    Note: the special libraries won't be updated automatically on the
    target system. Doing so is the responsibility of the user.
** Global installation
   If the libraries and utilities are considered stable and the should
   be available to everyone (without having to recompile them) the
   script =copySwakFilesToSite.sh= in the directory
   =maintainanceScripts= can be used to copy them to the
   global site-specific directories.

   The script =removeSwakFilesFromSite.sh= in the directory
   =maintainanceScripts= removes all these files
   from the global directories. The =removeSwakFilesFromLocal.sh= does
   the same for the user directories (this makes sure that no
   self-compiled version /shadows/ the global version (which would
   lead to strange results)

   There is a =Makefile= attached. =make globalinstall= compiles =swak4Foam=
   and installs it into the global directories

   *Note:* Due to the order in which library direcories are searched
   for with =-L= a global installation might break the
   compilation. *If you don't know what this means: don't attempt a
   global installation*
** Packaging
*** Debian
    The command =build dpkg= builds a Debian/Ubuntu package for
    the *currently enabled* OpenFOAM-package. Note:
    - it is assumed that the currently used OF-version was also
      installed by the package manager
    - the =dev= package is built but poorly maintained
    Changes in the packaging should be done in the branch
    =debianPackaging= of the Mercurial-repository and later be
    merged to the =default=-branch.

    Packaging for OpenFOAM 2.x should be done in the branch
    =debianPackaging_2.x=

    *Note:* Due to the problem described with the global installation
    it might be necessary to deinstall a previously installed package
    to successfully build a new package
* Contents
** Libraries
   Collection of Libraries
*** =swak4FoamParsers=
    The basis of =swak4Foam=: the expression parsers with the logic to
    access the /OpenFOAM/ data-structures.

    None of the other software pieces compile without it.

    Also defines a subclass to =DataEntry= that uses
    =swak=-expressions and a function object =initSwakFunctionObject=
    that might be used if this fails
*** =simpleFunctionObjects=
    A collection of function objects that was previously separately
    available at
    http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_simpleFunctionObjects.

    Provides consistent output of values (on patches and fields) and
    more.
*** =groovyBC=
    Implements the infamous =groovyBC=. A boundary condition that
    allows arbitrary expressions in the field-file
*** =swakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects that have no additional requirements. Mainly used
    for manipulating and creating fields with expressions
    - addGlobalVariable :: Adds a variable to a global
         swak-namespace. Mainly used for debugging and resolving
         issues where a variable is needed in a BC before it is defined.
    - expressionField :: Create a new field from an expression
    - clearExpressionField :: Erase a field created with
         =expressionField=
    - manipulateField :: Modify a field in memory
    - createSampledSet :: Create a sampled set that can be used by
         other swak-entities (mainly boundary conditions)
    - createSampledSurface :: Create a sampled surface that can be used by
         other swak-entities (mainly boundary conditions)
    - swakCoded :: Child of the =coded=-functionObject that can read
                   and write global variables from and to
                   swak-namespaces

		   Assumes that the =SWAK4FOAM_SRC= environment
                   variable is set to the =Libraries=-directory of the
                   =swak4Foam=-sources
    - solveLaplacianPDE :: Solve the Poisson equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho T}{\partial t} - \nabla \lambda \nabla T =
S_{expl} + S_{impl} T
\end{equation}
         for $T$ where $\rho$, $\lambda$ and $S$ can be specified
    - solveTransportPDE :: Solve the transport equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho T}{\partial t} + \div(\phi,T) - \nabla \lambda \nabla T =
S_{expl} + S_{impl} T
\end{equation}
         for $T$ where $\rho$, $\lambda$ and $S$ can be
         specified. Plus the name of the field $\phi$
    - addForeignMeshes :: this allows specifying new foreign
         meshes. These can be used in subsequent function-objects or
         other swak-expressions on =internalFields=
    - foreignMeshesFollowTime :: this allows specifying a list of
         meshes whose time is set to the current time of the running
         case
*** =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects based on the =simpleFunctionObjects=-library
    (which is a prerequisite for compiling it).

    Evaluate expressions and output the results
*** =swakSourceFields=
    These classes allow to manipulate the solution. To use these the
    solver has to be modified.
    - expressionSource :: Field that is calculated from an
         expression. To be used as source-term or coefficient in some
         solver
    - forceEquation :: force an equation to fixed values in selected
                       locations. Has to be used after constructing
                       the equation and before solving
    These sources are based on =basicSource= and can be used
    *without* a modification of the solver (they are only available in
    the 2.x version):
    - SwakSetValue :: sets values according to a mask or the
                      mechanism provided by =basicSource=
    - SwakExplicitSource :: Uses the calculated source term on the
         right hand side of the equation
    - SwakImplicitSource :: Uses a calculated scalar-field to add an
         implicit source term (source is *without* the actual field)
*** =swakFvOptions=
    Starting from OpenFOAM 2.2 this library has additional =fvOptions=
*** =swakTopoSources=
    =topoSources= for =cellSet= and =faceSet=. Can be used with the
    =cellSet= and =faceSet=-utilities
*** =swakFiniteArea=
    Implements parsers for the =finiteArea=-stuff in 1.6-ext. Also
    implements =groovyBC= for =areaField= and =expressionField= and
    other function objects
*** =groovyStandardBCs=
    Collection of boundary conditions that give standard boundary
    conditions the possibility to use expression for the coefficients

    Contributions to this library are explicitly encouraged. Please
    use the Mercurial-branch =groovyStandardBCs= to /groovyify/
    standard boundary conditions.
*** =pythonIntegration=
    Embeds a =Python=-interpreter.

    - =pythonIntegrationFunctionObject= :: Executes =Python=-code
         at the usual execution times of functionObjects. The
         interpreter keeps its state

    This library is only compiled if the paths to the Python-Headers
    are configured in the =swakConfiguration=-file (see above)
*** =simpleLagrangianFunctionObjects=
    Function objects that allow the easy addition of lagrangian
    clouds to a case. No other libraries from =swak4Foam= are needed
    for this
*** =simpleSearchableSurfaces=
    Additional =searchableSurfaces= (for use in =snappyHexMesh=)
    which include boolean operations for other surfaces and
    coordinate transformations
*** =fluFunctionObjectDriver=
    Driver for =functionObjects= that implemented entirely in =Python=
    using the =pythonFlu=-library
*** =swakLagrangianParser=
    Parser for calculating expressions on clouds of lagrangian particles
*** =swakStateMachine=
    Library with function objects and plugin functions to work with
    simple state machines
*** =swakDynamicMesh=
    Library with classes that combine swak with dynamic meshes
*** =functionPlugins=
    Directory with a number of libraries with function-plugins:
    - swakFacSchemesFunctionPlugin :: functions with selectable
         discretization schemes for FAM (only used in 1.6-ext)
    - swakFvcSchemesFunctionPlugin :: functions with selectable
         schemes for FVM
    - swakLocalCalculationsFunctionPlugin :: calculations that are
         local to a cell (Minimum of the face values or so)
    - swakMeshQualityFunctionPlugin :: calculate mesh quality criteria
         like orthogonality, skewness and ascpect ratio
    - swakRandomFunctionPlugin :: different random number
         distributions. Currently only exponential
    - swakSurfacesAndSetsFunctionPlugin :: calculates distances from
         =sampledSurfaces= and =sampledSets= and projects calculated
         values from these onto a volume field
    - swakThermoTurbFunctionPlugin :: Access functions from the
         thermophysical model and the turbulence model in the current
         region. Loads the model only if necessary
    - swakTransportTurbFunctionPlugin :: Same as above but for
         incompressible models
    - swakLagrangianCloudSourcesFunctionPlugin :: Functions that get
         informations like source terms from clouds of particles (due
         to technical reasons this works only for the regular
         /intermediate/ clouds)
    - swakVelocityFunctionPlugin :: Functions that work on the flow
         field (currently only the local Courant-number)
    - swakChemistryModelFunctionPlugin :: Functions that calculate
         chemistry properties (reaction rates etc)
    - swakRadiationModelFunctionPlugin :: Functions that calculate
         properties of the radiation model
    - swakMeshWaveFunctionPlugin :: Functions that use the
         =MeshWave=-algorithm to calculate grid-dependent properties
         like number of mesh layers
**** lagrangianCloudAdaptors-directory
     Because of the templating all plugin-functions have to be
     reinstaniated for new particle classes. The libraries in this
     directory
     - reimplement the functions from
       =swakLagrangianCloudSourcesFunctionPlugin=
     - the =CloudProxy= for the =cloud= parser
     for special particle classes. These are
     - coalCloudAdaptor :: the library =libswakCoalCloudAdaptor= that
          handels the =CoalParcel=-class
     These libraries have to be included in the =libs=-entry to
     be able to handle these libraries
** Utilities
*** =funkySetFields=
    Utility that allows creation and manipulation of files with
    expressions
*** =funkySetAreaFields=
    Utility like =funkySetFields= for =areaFields= (only works with
    1.6-ext)
*** =funkySetBoundaryField=
    Sets any field on a boundary to a non-uniform value based on an
    expression.

    Acts without deeper understanding of the underlying boundary condition
*** =replayTransientBC=
    Utility to quickly test whether a groovyBC gives the expected
    results. Writes the specified fields with the applied boundary
    condition but doesn't do anything else.

    Can be used for other BCs as well
*** =funkyDoCalc=
    Evaluates expressions that are listed in a dictionary using data
    that is found on the disc and prints summarized data (min, max,
    average, sum) to the screen
*** =calcNonUniformOffsetsForMapped=
    Calculates the =offsets=-entry in the =polyMesh/boundary=-file
    according to the specification in a dictionary. Only needed if you
    have mapped patches and the regular uniform offset is not enough
    for your purposes
*** =fieldReport=
    Utility that quickly does some quantitative analysis (minimum,
    maximum, average etc ) on a field on the disc (internal field but
    also patches, sets, zones, ...)
*** =funkyPythonPostproc=
    This utility loads specified fields into memory, executes a list
    of user-specified function objects whose data is then passed to a
    python script which does the user-specified analysis.
*** =funkySetLagrangianField=
    Utility to calculate fields for a lagrangian cloud (or setting it
    up from scratch)
*** =writeBoundarySubfields=
    Utility to write fields with subfields from boundary conditions
    like =refValue= for post-processing
** Examples
   If not otherwise noted cases are prepared by a simple
   =blockMesh=-call.

   *Note*: All the cases here are strictly for demonstration purposes and
   resemble nothing from the 'real world'

   *Note*: Due to various changes in the case syntax between OpenFOAM
    2.0 and 2.2 (for instance =thermophysicalProperties=, wall
    functions etc) not all of the examples work with all
    OpenFOAM-installations "out of the box". Slight adaptions may be
    necessary

    Some of the cases use the =pyFoamPrepareCase.py=-utility of [[https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/PyFoam][PyFoam]]
    to set up the case for the current OpenFOAM-version

    To run on multiple OpenFOAM-versions the cases sometimes have more
    entries in the dictionaries

    Also have a look at =Documentation/exampleCompatibilityMatrix.org=
    to see with which versions which cases should work.

    Usually the cases have been derived from regular tutorial
    cases. After their first implementation they were only adapted to
    run in new OpenFOAM versions but improvements in the tutorials are
    usually not ported. The reason is that these are just example
    cases for =swak4Foam=, not /best practice/ examples for OpenFOAM

    OF-versions use the sources labeled =_pre2.1=.

    The only modifications to the original solver are found at the end
    of =createFields.H= and in =UEqn.H= (the added source terms).
*** InterFoamWithFixed
    Demonstrates usage of =forceEquation=

    Due to differences in the original =interFoam=-solver this doesn't
    work on certain OpenFOAM-versions (most specifically
    =1.6-ext=). The current solver works with 2.1. For older
    OF-versions use the sources labeled =_pre2.1=.

    The only modifications to the original solver are found at the end
    of =createFields.H= and in =UEqn.H= (the fixing of the velocities).

*** tests
    Simple test cases for specific features. The names of the
    directories should give you a hint what is tested there. Most of

     can be switched on is a location dependent pressure jump on one
     of the interfaces implemented with =groovyBCJumpAMI=
*** BugCases
    These are cases provided by users to demonstrate bugs. Not
    maintained nor documented and may be removed at any time
** =maintainanceScripts=
   Undocumented scripts used for maintaining =swak4Foam=. *If you
   don't understand them, don't use them*
** Documentation
   Additional documentation. Most written in =org-mode=

   Current contents:
   - swak4FoamReference :: Reference manual of swak4Foam. Especially
        concepts like expression syntax and parameters
** releaseTesting
   Scripts and configuration to test for a release in a virtual
   machine using =vagrant=. Also to be used for packaging
** distroPatches
   Patches that have to be applied to releases to get swak4Foam to
   work with them. These are only needed to fix problems of the
   distributions
* Bug reporting and Development
** Bug reports
   The preferred place for bug reports is
   http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/search.php?project_id=10&sticky_issues=on&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=90

   A sourceforge-account is required for reporting

   Please *always* report the FOAM-version you use. As =OpenFOAM-dev=
   is a moving target only bug-reports that add fixes are handled for this.
*** Things to do before reporting bug
    If you're reporting a bug about the compilation please run
    =Allwmake= *twice* and only report the messages from the second
    run. This makes analyzing the log easier as only the unsuccessful
    commands will be reported.

    If the problem seems to be a missing library rerun the compilation
    to make sure that there wasn't a problem with that.
** Development
   Contributions to to =swak4Foam= are most welcome. If you want to
   contribute clone the Mercurial archive of the sources
: hg clone http://openfoam-extend.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/openfoam-extend/swak4Foam
   Change to the branch that you want to improve (usually =default=)
   and create a new branch
: hg branch <branchName>
   where =<branchname>= is an easily identifiable name that makes the
   purpose of the branch clear (for instance
   =hotfix/WrongRandomFunction= or =feature/HyperbolicFunctions=). Don't
   work on the =default= branch or any other branches that are not
   "yours". Such contributions will not be merged

   Once development on the branch is finished export the relevant
   changesets with
: hg export <nodeID>
   (=nodeID= being the ids of "your" changesets) and send them to the
   maintainer (or attach them to a bug report on Manits). The changes
   will be reviewed and merged into the =default= branch (do not
   attempt to do this yourself). Patches generated with =hg export=
   make sure that all changes are attributed to the original developer
   (you).

   An alternative would be the =bundle= command. Just do
: hg bundle <bundlefile>
   and then send the =bundlefile=. This will include *all* commits
   that are not in the upstream repository and will allow similar
   inclusion in the upstream as =export=.

   Once you have proven by successfully submitting changesets via =hg
   export= you can ask for write access to the mercurial repository.

   Only if you got through Mercurial it can be ensured that your
   contribution is recognized (if you want to stay anonymous send
   patches).
*** Suggest reading
    These topics may be "new" for the average OF-developer:
    - Mercurial :: A short tutorial on this can be found at
                   http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide/. If you already
                   know =git= the
                   http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/GitConcepts may
                   be enough for you
    - bison/flex :: This pair of compiler generator tools generate the
                    parsers for the expressions. Google for a tutorial
                    that looks promising to you.

		    For a short example that shows how a new function
		    was added to two parsers have a look at this
		    changeset that added the =cpu()=-function to the
		    field and the the patch-parser (usually you'll
		    have to write a new method for the driver too):

*** Special branches
    Currently the main branches are:
    - default :: The *main* branch. This is the brancht that the
                 general public will receive. It compiles under
                 OpenFOAM 2.0 and higher
    - debianPackaging :: Branch for generating new Debian-packages of
         =swak4Foam=. If somebody wants to "inherit" this: contact the
         maintainer
    - develop :: Actual development branch
*** Distributed bug-tracking
    As an experimental feature distributed bug-tracking was introduced
    using the /Artemis/-extension for /Mercurial/ (see
    [[http://hg.mrzv.org/Artemis/]]). An up-to-date version can be
    installed by
: hg clone http://hg.mrzv.org/Artemis/
    somewhere and installing the plugin by editing =.hgrc=.

    This is *not* the official bug-tracker for =swak4Foam=. It is used
    for keeping track of new features that are to be introduced to
    =swak4Foam= and may be discontinued if the experiment proves to be
    unsuccessful.
*** Maintaining feature and hotfix-branches
    The repository comes with a =.hgflow=-file that is set for the
    =hgflow=-extension found at
    [[https://bitbucket.org/yujiewu/hgflow/wiki/Home]] (there are multiple
    branches of this extension. This *seems* to be the most up-to date
    and still under active development)

    In the future this repository will try to stick to the model
    described in [[http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/]]

* Known bugs
  The following list is not complete. If the Artemis extension (see
  above) is installed then
: hg ilist
  gives a more up-to-date list
** Moving meshes and =sampledSurfaces=
   It seems that with moving meshes =sampledSurfaces= don't get
   updated. This seems to be a problem with OpenFOAM itself (the
   regular =surfaces=-functionObject doesn't get updated. This is
   currently investigated
** Missing support for interpolation and point-Fields
   Apart from patches and internal fields the support for
   interpolation from cells to faces (and vice versa) is incomplete as
   well as point fields (although they are supported in the grammar)
** Caching of loaded fields not working
   This is especially evident for the =funkyDoCalc=-example
** Possible enhancements of the code
   Not really bugs, but stuff that bugs me
*** Pointers in the driver code
    This is necessary because of =bison=. Investigate possibilities to
    replace these by =tmp= and =autoPtr=
** Possible memory loss
   =valgrind= reports some lost memory for stuff that is not directly
   allocated by =swak4Foam= (in OpenFOAM-sources)

   Will investigate. Relevant places are marked by comments in the
   code. Also the construction of =sampledSet= seems to loose memory

   Currenly problematice parts seem to be:
   - update and =magSf=-calculation of =SampledSurface= (marked in
     =SampledSurfaceExpressionDriver.C=)
   - Python interpreter (but no calls in swak were found in the
     stack-trace that could be responsible)
** Non-treatment of the inner product =&= of symmetric tensors
   Before OpenFOAM 2.1 the inner product of two symmetric tensors was
   a symmetric tensor. Since 2.1 it is a general tensor. As the
   general treatment in the grammar would be confusing currently the
   this product was removed from the grammar and therefor will not be
   correctly parsed
** No point-vector construction for Subsets
   The same problem that was mentioned in
   [[https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=130]]
   is also true for subsets. But as the interpolation is not
   implemented for most subsets this will be postponed
** No tab-completion for regular Python-shell and old IPython-versions
   The tab-completion does not work except for up-to-date versions of
   IPython. This seems to be a problem with the =readline=-library
   inside an embedded Python. Low priority
** Failure of =groovyBC= for =commsType= =blocking=
   If the =commsType= is set to =blocking= then the MPI-communications
   of =groovyBC= cause problems in MPI and a fatal error.

   Currently the only workaround is to edit
   =$WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/controlDict= so that a different =commsType=
   is used (=nonBlocking= or =scheduled=)
** Failure with =sampledSurfaces= that change size on certain distros
   Older Foam-versions had the problem that when the surface changes
   the size then certain values (especially the =mag= are not properly
   recalculated).

   This causes this bug:
   https://sourceforge.net/p/openfoam-extend/ticketsswak4foam/231/

   The bug can not be fixed in =swak4Foam= but has to be fixed in the
   Foam-Distro
** =solverPerformanceToGlobalVariables= only works for scalar fields
   Currently only the data from scalar fields can be correctly
   parsed. If =vector=-fields are specified the function object fails
* History
** 2010-09-13 - version number : 0.1
   First Release
** 2010-12-18 - version number : 0.1.1
   New release
   Most important changes
*** Parser for =sampledSurfaces=
    Now expressions for the field on a sampled surface can be
    evaluated. All =sampledSurfaces= offered by OpenFOAM now can be
    used
*** Multiline =variables=
    The =variables= entry (most notably used in =groovyBC= and
    =swakExpression=) now can be a list of strings. This allows some
    kind of "formatting" (one expression per line) and should improve
    readability
*** Two maintainance-scripts were added
    These can copy the libraries and utilities to the global
    installation (for those who think that the swak4Foam-stuff is
    stable enough and want to 'bless' all users at their site with
    it). Note that any local installation still takes precedence
    (because =$FOAM_USER_APPBIN= is before =$FOAM_APPBIN= in the
    =$PATH=
*** Parsers using 'external variables' are now run-time selectable
    This allows the inclusion of other parsers with the regular
    =swak4Foam= parsers and include them seamlessly with the
    =variables=-mechanism for 'externals' (in other words: you can add
    your own parser in a separate library without having to change
    anything about the overall =swak4Foam=, but it behaves as if it
    was part of it)
** 2011-01-30 - version number : 0.1.2
*** Support for /Finite Area/-stuff
    Now there is support for the =finiteArea=-library found in
    1.6-dev. The support is found in a separate library
    =swakFiniteArea=. It has
    - a parser =faField= for =areaFields=
    - a parser =faPatch= for patches of =areaFields=
    - a variant of =groovyBC= for these patches
    - a computed source =faExpressionSource=
    - Function-object-variants for =areaFields=: =clearExpression=,
      =expressionField= and =manipulateField=. These work the same as
      their =volField=-counterparts
*** Bugfix for compiling in single precision
    See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=49
*** New function =nearDist=
    See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=44
** 2011-04-20 - version number : 0.1.3
   New features and changes are (this list is not complete):
*** New utility =funkySetAreaField=
    Like =funkySetFields= for /finiteArea/. Also writes out a volume
    field for easier post-processing
*** Refactoring of =groovyBC= and groovified boundary conditions
    Makes it easier to use the =groovyBC=-machinery for other boundary
    conditions. Two standard boundary conditions were
    /groovified/. Others may follow
*** Easier deployment
    If no =simpleFunctionObjects= are present they can be downloaded
    by a script.
    Also scripts to handle global installations of =swak4Foam=
*** Force equations
    A class to force equations to certain values according to
    expressions
*** New utility =funkyDoCalc=
    Utility does calculations on saved results and outputs single
    numbers (min, max, sum, average) to the terminal. Can be used for
    reporting or validity checks
*** Debian packaging
    Crude packaging for Debian
*** Lookup-tables
    A single-argument function can be specified as a piecewise linear
    function. Basically works like timelines but the argument can be
    something else (not only the time)
*** Stored variables
    Variables that store their values between time-steps. Applications
    are statistics or switches
*** Sampled sets
    Sampled sets can now also be used as en entity on which
    calculation is possible.
** 2011-07-26 - version number : 0.1.4
*** Port to OpenFOAM 2.0
    This is the first release that officially supports OpenFOAM 2.0

    Also it is the first release that incorporates the
    =simpleFunctionObjects=-library
*** New features:
**** Rewrite of =rand= and =randNormal=
     - These two functions now can receive an integer seed that
       determines the pseudo-randooom sequence generated by  these functions
     - Two functions =randFixed= and =randNormalFixed= were
       added. While the usual =rand= functions generate a different
       result at every time-steps for these functions the pseudo-random
       sequence is determined *only* by the seed (not by the timestep)
**** Binary =min= and =max=
     Take the bigger/smaller of two fields. Helps avoid =?:=-operations
**** Allow writing of only volume-fields in =funkySetAreaFields=
     Application: If the results of the calculation are only needed in
     ParaView
**** Internal changes
     - Use =autoPtr= for sets
     - Update sets that change in memory or on disc
*** Bug-fixes
**** =funkySetAreaFields= did not check for the correct fields
     Fixed by Petr Vita
**** =surfaceProxy= uses the wrong geometric data
**** Avoid floating point exceptions with division of fields
     Calculated boundaries were $0$ and caused a division by zero
*** Packaging
**** Update Debian packaging
     - Packaging information for the currently used OF-version is
       generated (allows a separate =swak=-package for every OF-version
     - Submission to launchpad added
**** Deployment scripts
     Now install to =FOAM_SITE_APPBIN/LIBBIN=
** 2011-10-03 - version number : 0.1.5
*** New features
**** =replayTransientBC= now supports multiple regions
     Uses the usual =-region=-option. Looks for a separate dictionary
     in the =system=-directory of that region
**** =replayTransientBC= allows execution of functionObjects
     This can be switched on using the =allowFunctionObjects=-option
**** =Python=-embedding
     Allows the execution of Python-Code in a functionObject

     This feature is still experimental and the organization of the
     libraries is subject to change
**** Global variables
     It is now possible to define variables that are 'global': They
     can be read in any entity.

     Currently these variables can only be uniform.

     To access global variables the specification-dictionary has to
     have a =wordList= named =globalScopes=. The scopes are searched
     in that order for the names of global variables. Having scopes
     allows some kind of separation of the variables
**** Using OF 2.0 codeStreams
     Adds a functionObject =swakCoded= that extends the
     =coded=-functionObject to read and write global variables
**** Simplified boundary condition =groovyBCFixedValue=
     Added a boundary condition than allows to only fix the
     values. This should help to avoid problems with cases that don't
     like =mixed= (on which the regular =groovyBC= is based)
**** Function objects to solve PDEs
     Two function objects that solve /Partial Differential Equations/
     during a run have been added:
     - one that solves a laplacian (Poisson) equation
     - one that solves the transport equation for a scalar
     The relevant coefficients (including explicit and implicit source
     terms) can be specified using expressions
*** Administrative and packaging
**** Inject =swak4Foam= into a distro
     Added a script that takes the current sources, copies them into
     the appropriate places of a =OpenFOAM=-installation and slightly
     rewrites them to compile in this place. What happens then
     (committing them into the repository or just plain compilation)
     is up to the maintainer
**** Absorb =simpleFunctionObjects=
     As many parts of =swak4Foam= depend on it the
     =simpleFunctionObjects= have now been absorbed into
     =swak4Foam=. They can still be compiled on their own
*** Bugfixes
**** Variables not working for parallel computations
     If a variable is defined and the patch which it is defined on
     doesn't have any faces the variable is reported on that processor
     as /not existing/ and the whole run fails
** 2012-01-04 - version number : 0.1.6
*** Cases changed
**** =circulatingSplash=
     Fixed according to a suggestion by Andreas Otto. Now runs again
     (used to crash some time-steps into the beginning)
*** Infrastructure
**** Check for correct =bison=-version
     The =Allwmake=-script now checks for the correct bison-version
     (and the existence of =bison=) and fails if it doesn't seem to be
     the right one
**** Supply a header with preprocessor-symbols about the used OF-version
     To allow distinguishing different OF-versions as discussed in the
     bug report
     [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=114]]
     the =Allwmake=-script now generates a header file
     =foamVersion4swak.H= that defines the symbols
     =FOAM_VERSION4SWAK_MAJOR=, =FOAM_VERSION4SWAK_MINOR= and
     =FOAM_VERSION4SWAK_PATCH=
*** Technical
**** Refactoring of the FieldDriver
     - now can also produce surfaceFields
     - full support of =tensor=, =symmTensor= and =sphericalTensor=
**** Refactoring of the FaFieldDriver
     - now can also produce edgeFields
     No support for tensors yet
**** Writing of =storedVariables=
     If necessary (for instance =swakExpression=-functionObject) the
     =storedVariables= are written to disc (into a subdirectory
     =swak4Foam= of the timestep) and are reread at the start. This
     allows consistent restarts (for instance if a flow was summed
     using the variable) *if the expressions stay the same*.
**** =simpleFunctionObjects= now write vectors and tensors without brackets
     Data files can now be written without brackets but each component on
     its own. The number of entries in the header is not adjusted
**** A /default mesh/ for the drivers exists
     For drivers that don't have access to a =fvMesh= a default mesh
     exists. This default mesh is defined by the first =fvMesh= that
     is used during the construction of *any* driver.

     Definition of the default mesh can be forced using the
     =initSwakFunctionObject= (see the test case =flowRateAngledDuct=)
*** New features
**** General =phi= in =solveTransportPDE=
     Due to the refactoring of the =FieldDriver= now =phi= can be
     specified by a general expression (instead of 'only' a
     field-name)
**** =funkySetFields= now also writes surfaceFields
     Can write =surfaceVector= and =surfaceScalar=-Fields. Condition
     has to be consistent
**** Function objects now =surfaceField=-aware
     =expressionField= and =manipulateField= now can create or modify
     =surfaceFields=
**** =funkySetFields= and function objects support tensors
     =funkySetFields= and the function objects =expressionField= and
     =manipulateField=  now also work with the three tensor-types
**** Extension of the =expressionToFace= =topoSet=
     If the expression evaluates to a =surfaceField= then this is used
     as a flag whether or not the face is in the =faceSet=. If the
     expression evaluates to a =volScalarField= then the old semantic
     applies (faces are in the set if one cell is =true= and the other
     is =false=).

     This only works for internal faces
**** =addGlobalVariable= allows setting more than one value
     If there is an entry =globalVariables= then this dictionary is
     used to set the variables
**** Function object =calculateGlobalVariables=
     Calculates variables and then pushes them to a global namespace
**** Generate a dummy =phi= in =replayTransientBC=
     New option added that generates a =phi= field with value $0$ to
     keep boundary conditions like =inletOutlet= happy
**** Function object to dump expression results
     The functionObject =dumpSwakExpression= dumps the complete
     results of a swakExpression to file at each timestep. This
     produces huge files and is therefor not endorsed
**** Additional options for =funkySetFields=
     Add the options =allowFunctionObjects= and =addDummyPhi= to
     execute functionObjects and add a =phi=-field (for fields that
     require these)
**** Boundary condition =groovcBCDirection=
     Based on the =directionMixed= boundary condition this allows to
     set a boundary condition as a Dirichlet-condition only in certain
     directions while in the other directions it is a
     gradient-condition
**** Boundary condition =groovyBCJump=
     Boundary condition that imposes a jump in the value on a cyclic
     boundary condition pair (based on =jumpCyclic=). Only works for
     scalar values
**** =simpleFunctionObjects= write CSV-files
     Setting the option =outputFileMode= to =csv= writes
     CSV-files. The option-value =foam= is the default (old style). The
     option-value =raw= writes the values delimited by spaces (no
     brackets for vectors and tensors)
**** Submeshes automatically read if =searchOnDisc= specified
     If a submesh is not yet in memory and the option =searchOnDisc=
     is set, the mesh is automatically read into memory and kept there
**** Conditional =functionObjects=
     The =simpleFunctionObjects=-library now has a number of
     functionObjects that allow the conditional execution of a list of
     function objects.

     These are
     - executeIfExecutableFits :: if the name of the executable fits a
          regular expression the function objects are executed
     - executeIfObjectExists :: if a named object exists (or
          alternatively: doesn't exist) in the registry execute the
          function objects. Type checking also implemented
     - executeIfEnvironmentVariable :: execute if an environment
          variable satisfies a certain condition (exists, doesn't
          exist, fits a regular expression)
     - executeIfFunctionObjectPresent :: execute if a specific
          functionObject is present. This can help prevent failures if
          a functionObject is missing for technical reasons
     In addition the =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=-library has
     - executeIfSwakObject :: Evaluates a logical swak-expression. The
          results are either accumulated using logical /or/ (if *one*
          value is true the result will be true) or logical /and/ (all
          values have to be true)
     The =pythonIntegration=-library has
     - executeIfPython :: Evaluates a Python-code-snipplet that
          returns a value. If this value is "true" in Pythons
          standards then the functionObjects are executed
**** =functionObject= that reads gravitation
     =simpleFunctionObjects= has an additional function object that
     reads the direction of gravitation. The purpose is to assist
     boundary conditions like =buoyantPressure= that rely on it to
     work. Best used together with conditional function objects ("If
     =g= is missing ....")
**** PDE-functionObjects for =finiteArea=
     Solve transport and laplacian equation
**** Subclass to =DataEntry= that uses /swak/-expressions
     This is defined in the =swak4FoamParsers=-library. The class
     needs a default mesh defined to construct the driver. Definition
     of the default mesh (if no other driver was constructed in some
     function-object or by a =groovyBC=) can be forced using the
     =initSwakFunctionObject= (see the test case =flowRateAngledDuct=)
**** =funkySetAreaField= now also writes edgeFields
     Similar to the =surfaceFields= in =funkySetFields=
*** Bug fixes
**** Compilation with Intel-Compiler possible
     The =Utilities= failed with the Intel-compiler. Compilation now
     falls back to good old =g++=
**** Access to tensor-components not working
     Because the tokens were not defined in the =flex=-files getting
     tensor components with =tensor.xx= did not work. Fixed
**** Constants for surfaceFields not working
     Because surfaceFields know no =zeroGradient= the template
     =makeConstant= did not work
**** =snGrad= does not work for patches if the file is on disc
     Change so that the field gets temporarily loaded to calculate the
     gradient on the patch. Same for =internalField= and
     =neighbourField=
**** =potentialFoam= does not correctly use a =groovyBC=
     The reason is that =groovyBC= usually doesn't get evaluated
     during construction. The reason is that it is hard to tell
     whether all required fields are already in memory. The current
     fix is a workaround: setting =evaluateDuringConstruction= to
     =true= forces the BC to be evaluated during construction
**** Extra evaluation of boundary conditions causes failure
     Extra evaluation of boundary condition that should fix the
     problem with =calculated= patches causes =funkySetFields= to fail
     with stock boundary conditions if not all fields are present in
     memory
*** Discontinued features
**** =groovyFlowRateInletVelocity=
     This boundary condition will be removed in future releases
     because the base class now supports the more general
     =DataEntry=-class for which a =swak=-subclass exists
** 2012-04-13 - version number : 0.2.0 Friday the 13th
*** New features
**** Region name in =simpleFunctionObject=.outputs
     To distinguish the output of various instances of
     =functionObjects= from the =simpleFunctionObjects=-library in
     multi-region cases the screen-output is prefixed with the region
     name. For the default region nothing changes. Directory names
     stay the same as they are unambiguous anyway (they contain the
     name of the functionObject)
**** Temporal operators =ddt= and =oldTime=
     For fields (not expressions!) the value at a previous timestep
     can be gotten via =oldTime(field)= if that information exists
     (also for =funkySetFields= if the corresponding file =field_0=
     exists.

     For fields that support it (basically volume-fields) there is
     also a =ddt=-operator that calculates the explicit
     time-derivative (if information about the last timestep exists)

     Currently implemented for
     - internalFields :: =oldTime= and =ddt=
     - patch :: only =oldTime=
     - cellSet,cellZone :: only =oldTime=
     - sampledSurface,sampledSet :: only =oldTime=
     - faceSet,faceZone :: =oldTime=
     - internalFaFields :: =oldTime= and =ddt=
     - faPatch :: only =oldTime=

     If there is no old time value stored and in the parser dictionary
     the parameter =prevIterIsOldTime= is set, then the previous
     iteration value is used as the old time.
**** Boundary condition =groovcBCDirection=
     Based on the =directionMixed= boundary condition this allows to
     set a boundary condition as a Dirichlet-condition only in certain
     directions while in the other directions it is a
     gradient-condition

     *Note*: this should have been in the last release but was
      forgotten to merge into the default branch
**** Boundary condition =groovyBCJump=
     Boundary condition that imposes a jump in the value on a cyclic
     boundary condition pair (based on =jumpCyclic=). Only works for
     scalar values

     *Note*: this should have been in the last release but was
      forgotten to merge into the default branch
**** Function to return the position of minimum and maximum
     The functions =minPosition= and =maxPosition= return the position
     of the minimum or the maximum of a scalar field

     This is implemented for all field types
**** Support for =pointFields= in the field-parsers
     Now can read and generate pointFields.

     Detailed features (apart from the standard symbols) are:
     - Function =point= generates a constant =pointScalarField=
     - Function =pts()= returns a =pointVectorField= with the point
       positions
     - Functions =pzone= and =pset= generate logical fields according
       to existing pointZones or pointSets
     - Functions =interpolateToCell= and =interpolateToPoint=
       interpolate from pointFields to volFields and from volFields to
       pointFields

     Utilities and functionObjects affected by this are
     - =funkySetFields=
     - new topoSource =expressionToPoint=
     - =expressionField= and =manipulateField= now can deal with pointFields
**** Support for tensors in the =finiteArea=-field parser
     The =faField=-parser now supports tensors, symmetric tensors and
     spherical tensors.

     Not all operators are supported because the are not instantiated
     in 1.6-ext
**** New convenience-variables for the Python-Integration
     These variables are added in the namespace to ease the writing of
     Python-code whose output is consistent with OF
     - timeName :: Name of the current time as a string. Allows the
                   construction of directory names
     - outputTime :: Boolean that indicates whether this is a timestep
                     where OpenFOAM will write output
**** Additional operators from the =fvc=-namespace
     The missing operators from the =fvc=-namespace have been added to
     the Field-parser. These are
     - =d2dt2= :: for all volumeFields
     - =flux= :: for all volumFields. Needs a surfaceField as a first
                 argument
     - =meshPhi= :: for volume-vector-fields. Optional with a
                    scalar-field that acts as the density as the first
                    argument. Only works in the context of a solver
                    with a dynamic mesh and hasn't been tested yet
     The only missing operators from the =fvc=-namespace are
     =volumeIntegrate=/=domainIntegrate=. These have been omitted as
     they are trivial to implement using other functions
*** Infrastructure
**** Full parallel compilation
     Thanks to patches supplied by Bruno Santos (see
     [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=105]])
     compilation of the libraries is now possible in parallel
**** Version numbers and version number reporting
     Releases up to now got a version number. Utilities now report the
     version number. This should make it easier to find out whether
     problems are due to an old version

     Still looking for a way to do that for the libraries (so that
     they will report it if dynamically loaded)
*** Packaging
**** Update of the Debian-Packaging
     =make dpkg= now genrates also a valid package if the current
     OpenFOAM-installation is *not* installed using the =dpkg=.
*** Changes in the behavior
**** Directory variables in Python-integration
     For parallel runs the content of the =caseDir=-variable changed
     and a few variables have been added
     - caseDir :: in parallel runs now points to the =FOAM_CASE=
                  instead of the processor subdirectory
     - systemDir :: points to the global =system=-directory
     - constantDir :: points to the global =constant=-directory
     - procDir :: in parallel runs points to the
                  processor-subdirectory of the current CPU
     - meshDir :: The mesh data (of the current processor in parallel
                  runs)
     - timeDir :: Directory where data would be written to at the
                  current time (processor dependent)
**** User must acknowledge parallelization in Python-integration
     In parallel runs the user must set the =isParallelized= to =true=
     if the =parallelMasterOnly= is set to =false=.

     With that he indicates that in his opinion the Python-code has no
     bad side-effects in parallel runs and that he doesn't blame
     swak4Foam if anyting bad happens
*** Bug fixes
**** =interFoam=-based example solvers do not compile on 2.1
     As reported in
     [[https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=119]]
     due to a change the way the PISO-loop is treated the
     =interFoamWithSources= and =interFoamWithFixed= don't compile
     with 2.1 anymore.

     To avoid =#ifdef= in the solver sources there is now a separate
     set of sources (labeled =pre2.1=) for older versions. The regular
     sources work with 2.1 (and hopefully the following)
**** =-allowFunctionObjects=-option not working for =replayTransientBC=
     Function-objects only work with the
     =while(runTime.loop())=-construct in 2.1. The utility now uses
     this.
**** Field itself can not be used in =funkySetBoundaryField=
     Bug reported:
     [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=124]]

     An expression like =2*U= did not work for the field =U=. Reason
     was that the registry already held an object called =U= (the
     dictionary representation of the field) and therefor refused to
     load/register another =U=.

     Has been fixed by de-registering the dictionary =U= immediately
     after loading.
**** No gradient for vectors in FieldParser
     The gradient for a vector field (result: a tensor field) was not
     calculated. It is now part of the grammar
**** Some operators for tensors not working in 1.6-ext
     =tr=, =inv= and =det= were not working for some tensort types in
     1.6-ext. The parser now fails if such a combination is
     used. Works OK for other OF-versions

     Also introduced a workaround for certain operators not being
     properly defined for pointFields (by using the internal fields)
**** =x=, =y=, =z= and =xy= etc not available as field names
     These symbols could not be used as field names because they were
     used for the components of vectors and tensors

     Now these names are only used if the =.=-operator asks for a
     component. This is implemented for these parsers
     - FieldValues
     - PatchValues
     - SubsetValues (all Zones, sets and samples)
     - finiteArea-Parsers: faPatch and faField
**** Missing tensor components for point-Fields in some parsers
     All parsers except the field-parser were missing the access to
     tensor components in the grammar
**** No vector construction possible for point-vectors (and tensors) in PatchField
     As mentioned in
     [[https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=130]]
     it was not possible to construct a point-vector field using
     =vector(toPoint(1),toPoint(1),toPoint(1))=. Same for tensors
**** Incomprehensible error message in =funkySetFields= if the field is missing
     The error message in =funkySetFields= that was issued when a
     field is supposed to be created was not very helpful (something
     about the field currently being an =IOobject=)
**** Missing =magSqr= in parsers
     This function was reported missing on the message board
**** Wrong size when composing vectors and tensors for point-fields
     The composed objects got their size from the current parser, not
     the components. This resulted in a segmentation-fault for
     pointFields
**** =icc= does not compile =executeIfExecutableFitsFunctionObject= on Linux
     Preprocessor symbol =linux= unknown. Replaced with =__linux__=
**** Enhancement to the =trackDictionary=-functionObject
     Now handles bad or non-existent filenames for dictionaries to
     track

     Fix provided by Martin Beaudoin
** 2012-10-18 - version number : 0.2.1
*** Requirements
**** =flex 2.5.35=
     This version is needed for the reentrant parsers. =2.5.33= *may*
     work but is untested. Version =2.5.4= which is on some old
     systems definitely does not work
**** =bison 2.4=
     Version 2.3 compiles but there is an offset-problem with the
     locations that breaks the Plugin-functionality

     Mac-users will have to install =bison= from another source (for
     instance =MacPorts=)
*** Bug fixes
**** Make sure that =Allwmake= always uses the =bash=
     On Ubuntu =/bin/sh= is something else and the scripts fail.
     Hardcode to =/bin/bash=
**** =downloadSimpleFunctionObjects.sh= still in Makefile
     This script (which was removed long ago) was still referenced in
     the =Makefile=.
**** =grad= in fields added dimensions
     =grad= and other operators from =fvc= added dimensions to values
     that were supposed to be dimensionless. This has been fixed
**** Default =condition= for surface fields wrong size in =funkySetFields=
     Due to a typo the constructed condition field was too short for
     surface-fields (too long for volume-fields, but that didn't matter)
**** =mappedFvPatch= not treated like regular patches
     The field-driver created patch fields there as =calcuated= when
     =zeroGradient= would have been more appropriate
**** =flip()= for =faceSet= not correctly calculated
     A =SortableList= was used which meant that the vector with the
     flip values was not in the correct order
**** =fset()= crashes when =faceSet= has boundary faces
     This problem was due to a non-special treatment of faces on the
     boundary. Fixed (for =faceZone= as well).

     Also boundary faces are now honored in =expressionToFace= if the
     expression is a surface-field (for the volume-field logic
     boundary faces will never work)
**** =groovyBC= produced incorrect results with =wallHeatFlux= etc
     The reason was that during construction =refGradient=, =refValue=
     etc were not read correctly (if present).

     This is now fixed in =groovyBC= and the other BCs (=groovyBC= for
     pointFields and =groovyBCDirection=)
**** Global variables not found in =faField=
     The Lexer correctly identified the variable but the =getField=
     method did not know how to get it.

     Fixed
**** Wrong type of condition field in =funkySetAreaFields=
     If no condition was evaluated the utility generated a
     pseudo-field of the wrong length
**** =calculated=-patches $0$ for some operations
     For some operations in the =Field=-driver the
     =calculated=-patches had the value $0$ instead of the number of
     the next cell. This caused certain calculations to fail (give
     $0$)

     The =FaField=-driver did no fixing of the =calculated=-patches at
     all.

     This is fixed
**** =sqr= of a =vector= should produce a =symmTensor=
     Reported in
     http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=150

     Added the =sqr= at the right place to the grammars. Also some
     other missing tensor operations (=dev= and =symm=).
**** =funkySetFields= produced wrong values on processor patches
     Patch fields were not copied any no =correctBoundaryField= was
     called for technical reasons.

     Fix: values copied by hand
**** =sortedToc= does not exist for =1.6-ext=
     Introduced a preprocessor symbol that allows using sortedToc on
     newer versions
**** Wrong =size()= and =pointSize()= reported for =FaField=-driver
     This was due to a strange () (still don't know what happened
     there)
**** Memory leak in the field drivers
     The strings of parsed IDs were not properly deleted. Funnily this
     was done correctly in the Patch and the Subset-driver. Also for
     timelines-

     Also fixed a leak with the labels of plugin-functions that was
     present with all drivers
**** Maintenance scripts not working with non-=bash= =/bin/sh=
     Reported by Oliver Krueger that on systems where =/bin/sh= is not
     a =bash= anymore (newer Ubuntu and SuSE) the sourcing of
     =theFiles.sh= doesn't work anymore.

     Fixed and moved all the files to the =maintainanceScripts=-folder
**** =cof= and =diag= undefined
     Added. Diag had to be reprogrammed as it is not implemented for
     fields (probably for performance reasons).

     Also some tensor operators were missing (probably lost during copy/paste)
****  No new file created if number of patches for patchAverage changes
      Reported in
      https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=153

      Fixed by removing all file pointers if the number of patches changes
**** =variables= intolerant on spaces
     Spaces in the list of variables made the reading
     fail because words can't contain spaces. For instance
: "var =T*2;"
     Now all the spaces are removed before assigning to
     variables. This will also remove spaces on the "inside" thus
     making
: "v ar =T*2;"
     the same as the above expression. But it is unlikely that the
     call will be used in this way
**** Missing =div=-operations
     These valid =div=-operations were missing from the grammar:
     - Divergence of a volume-tensor (all three kinds) producing a
       vector
     - Divergence of a surface-tensor (all three kinds) producing a
       volume-tensor
**** Fields created by =expressionField= written too late
     Fields created by that function object were written with the
     value from the timestep before because the regular write occurs
     before the execution of the function objects.

     Fixed
**** =storedVariables= did not require a =initialValue=
     Now an initial value is required (instead of the default empty
     string which caused parser failure)
**** Dimension checking makes =expressionField= fail
     Reason is that during the calculation of the variables dimensions
     are checked.

     Now the functionObject switches the checking off. But a more
     general solution is desirable
**** =expressionField= at last timestep not written
     The functionObject does not write (and calculate) the field at
     the last timestep.

     Fixed with an one-liner
**** =groovyBC= makes =interFoam=-runs fail unpredictably
     Reason was an uninitialized =valueFraction= which sometimes has
     values that cause a floating point exception. Fixed
**** Global variables of different sizes break parallel runs
     Because =size()= was equal to the expected size on some
     processors. Not on all. Now the branch is taken if the size is
     equal on *all* processors
**** Fields treated with =readAndUpdateFields= were written one timestep too late
     Fields were not written after the boundary condition was
     updated. Now they are
*** Enhancements
**** Topology-operators now support =variables= etc
     The topology operators =expressionToCell=, =expressionToFace= and
     =expressionToPoint= now support =variables= and the other
     supporting keywords if being constructed with a dictionary (for
     instance from the =topoSet=-utility)
**** Fields touched by =manipulateField= being written
     Usually the manipulated version of the fields is not written as
     the manipulation happens *after* writing. The option
     =writeManipulated= enforces writing.

     Writing is not the default behavior to avoid side-effects
**** Indicator functions =onPatch= and =internalFace= added to field-expressions
     The function =onPatch(name)= returns a surface-field that is $1$
     on all faces that belong to patch =name=.

     The function =internalFace()= is $1$ on all internal faces and
     $0$ on all patches
**** Non-uniform second argument for =pow=
     Now the second argument to the =pow=-function can be a
     non-constant
**** Added transpose to the tensors
     The expression =A.T()= transposes the tensor =A= (for symmetrical
     and spherical tensors it leaves them untouched)
**** Added unit tensor =I= to parsers
     If no field =I= is defined then this is used as the unit-tensor
**** Added the /Hodge dual/ operator
     The unary operator =*= calculates for tensors and symmetrical
     tensors the hodge dual
**** =replayTransientBC= can now switch on function-objects via dictionary
     The optional entry =useFunctionObjects= switches on the execution
     of function objects during the calculation
**** =replayTransientBC= can now create a =phi=-field via dictionary
     The optional entry =addDummyPhi= creates a =phi=-field
**** =expressionField= now allows the specification of a dimension
     The =dimensions=-entry is now read at the same time the variables
     are read (this should work for all programs/functionObjects where
     the parser is not constructed using a dictionary but the
     dictionary is later searched for the =variables=-entry)
*** New features
**** Allow dynamically loaded plugins that add new functions to parsers
     This allows easy extension of the functionality of =swak4Foam=
     without modifying the grammar files.

     The way it works is that new functions are added to a
     runtime-selection table. If the grammar can not resolve a symbol
     as a built-in function or a field (but only then) it looks up the
     name in this table and evaluates the function. Parameters are
     parsed separately and can be:
     - primitive data types :: integer, float, string and word
     - swak-expression :: an expression parsed by one of the
          swak-parsers. The type of this expression does not
          necessarily have to be the same as the one of the 'main'
          expression.
     The first time a plugin function is searched =swak4Foam= prints a
     list of all the available functions of this type. Information
     included is the return type and the types of the parameters
     (these include the parser used, the expected type and a parameter
     name).

     Libraries with plugin-functions are added via the =libs=-entry in
     the =system/controlDict=

     A number of plugin-libraries are already included covering these
     topics:
     - Evaluation of functions of the turbulence, transport or thermo
       model
     - Different random number distributions
     - Functions to "project" =sampledSets= and =sampledSurfaces= onto
       a volume-field
     - Execute explicit discretization functions (like =grad=) but
       select the used scheme in the function instead of using the
       value from =fvSchemes=
     - Calculations of the mesh quality (same way =checkMesh= does)
       and return as fields
     - Do calculations locally on a cell (like the maximum on its
       faces)
     - Get the source fields and other properties from lagrangian
       clouds based on the basic intermediate cloud classes
       (Kinematic, Thermo, Reacting, ReactingMultiphase)

     It has been tried to make the names unique instead of
     short. Usually function names from one library are prefixed with
     the same short string.
**** Dynamically generated lists of =functionObjects=
     The new =dynamicFunctionObjectListProxy= in the
     =simpleFunctionObjects= can generate a =functionObjectList= from
     a string and execute them during the run like regular
     function-objects.

     The string is provided by a special class (the so called
     =dictionaryProvider=). Current implementations for the provider are:
     - fromFileDictionaryProvider :: reads the text from a dictionary
          file
     - stdoutFromCommandProvider :: executes a program and takes the
          standard output as the dictionary text
     - stdoutFromPythonScriptProvider :: executes a python-script and
          takes the stdout as the dictionary text
     The string must be in the format o a regular OpenFOAM-dictionary
     with an entry =functions= from which the functionObjects are
     generated
**** Function object =readAndUpdateFields=
     This FO in the =simpleFunctionObjects= reads a number of fields
     and updates their boundary conditions at every timestep.

     Main purpose is to let =groovyBC= do calculations and use the
     results for post-processing purposes

     Does not support surface-fields as these don't have a
     =correctBoundaryConditions=-method.

     Example of the usage in the =angledDuctImplicit=-case (the
     results are of limited value because of the temperature boundary
     condition)
**** Source terms based on =basicSource=
     Three source terms were added. These source terms are in the
     =swakSourceFields=-library and can be used with solvers that use
     the =sourcesProperties=-dictionary. The sources are
     - SwakSetValue :: sets values according to a mask or the
                       mechanism provided by =basicSource=
     - SwakExplicitSource :: Uses the calculated source term on the
          right hand side of the equation
     - SwakImplicitSource :: Uses a calculated scalar-field to add an
          implicit source term (source is *without* the actual field)
     These fields are only implemented in the 2.x-version of =swak=
     because the interface of =basicSource= is very different in 1.7
     and a backport was unnecessary
**** Function objects that stop a run gracefully
     =simpleFunctionObjects= now has a function object
     =writeAndEndFieldRange= that stops a run (and writes the last
     time) if a field is outside a specified range.

     A similar function object =writeAndEndSwakExpression= is in the
     =simpleSwakFunctionObjects= that stops if a swak-expression
     evaluates to true. =writeAndEndPython= does the same in
     =pythonIntegration=.

     Note: after the run is written one more timestep is calculated
     (this seems to be due to the fact that FOs are calculated at the
     start of a timestep). Also there are issues if the next timestep
     is a scheduled write-time (this only seem to be an issue with
     1.7.x. It all works fine on 2.1.x)
**** Function-objects to load thermophysical and turbulence models
     New function objects in the =simpleFunctionObjects= allow the
     loading of such models for solvers/utilities that don't have such
     models but where some functionObject (for instance) needs such a
     model to be in memory
**** Function-objects that create and evolve clouds of lagrangian particles
     Added as part of the =simpleFunctionObjects= some functionObjects
     that create a cloud of particles and evolve them at every
     timestep.

     The appropriate fields needed by every cloud have to be present
     (either supplied by the solver or via a =functionObject=)
**** Function-object =manipulatePatchField= to manipulate the field on patches
     This function objects allows the manipulation of patch fields
     like =manipulateField= allows the manipulation of the internal
     field. Only use if desperate
**** Delayed variables to simulate responses
     If a variable is declared in the =delayedVariables=-list then its
     behavior changes: when a value is assigned to that variable then
     the value is not immediately used but after the time specified in
     =delay=. Values are stored at intervals =storeInterval= and
     interpolated linearly. If no stored data is available then the
     value of the expression =startupValue= is used.

     This feature allows the modeling of boundary conditions that
     react with a delay to flow conditions
**** Allow preloading of fields in =funkySetFields=
     To satisfy the requirements of certain boundary conditions
     =funkySetFields= now allows the preloading of fields. This is
     only available in dictionary mode with the =preloadFields=-entry
     (for each entry in the =expressions=-list separately)
*** Infrastructure
**** Compilation script checks =SWAK4FOAM_SRC=
     The environment variable =SWAK4FOAM_SRC= is needed for the
     =swakCoded=-functionObject. The =Allwmake=-script now checks
     whether this variable exists and prints a message with the
     correct value if it doesn't. It also checks whether the value is
     correct and warns if it isn't
**** =Allwmake= creates symbolic links in =swakFiniteArea=
     The links to =mybison= and =myflex= are missing when the sources
     are downloaded as a tarball. The =Allwmake=-script now creates
     these links if they are missing
**** Reformatting of the parser sources
     Sources of the parsers have been completely reformatted to make
     them more readable and maintainable
**** Move non-parser sources in =swak4FoamParsers= into sub-directories
     Make the directory a little bit cleaner
** 2013-02-28 - version number : 0.2.2
*** Incompatibilities to previous versions
**** Python-integration library renamed
     To avoid clashes with other similar efforts (not that I know of
     any) the library =libpythonIntegration.so= has been renamed to
     =libswakPythonIntegration.so=.

     Usually only the =libs=-entry in the controlDict has to be
     changed (if the library is used at all). Names of the function
     objects stay the same
**** Change in write behaviour of =expressionField= and =manipulateField=
     Now the =outputControl=-entry is honored. If set wrong the field
     is *no longer* calculated/manipulated at every time-step
*** Bug fixes
**** 2.x-branch did not compile on 2.0
     Branch only compiled on 2.1, but not on 2.0 due to changes in the
     OpenFOAM-API

     Fix provided by Bruno Santos
**** =groovyBC=: =value= reset to $0$ during construction
     If no =refValue= is given during construction then a value of $0$
     is assumed for this and during a preliminary update the value is
     reset to this value.

     Fixed by using the =value= as the =refValue= if no =refValue= is
     specified
**** Unspecified =value= in =addGlobalVariables= produces obscure error message
     The error message occured much later when a =tmp= tried to copy a
     =NULL=-pointer and was not obvious at all for the general user. Fixed
**** Did not compile on =1.6-ext=
     1.6-ext does not consider the product of two symmetrical tensors
     to be symmetrical. Fixed
**** Python integration did not get global variables
     Change in the interface of the =ExpressionResult=-class
     broke the access of global variables from a
     Python-functionObject. Fixed
**** =maintainanceScripts/makeSwakVersionFile.py= failed when no Mercurial is installed
     This didn't influence the compilation (as there is already a
     current version file there) but confused people.
**** Non-uniform variables for =internalField= only worked correctly for volume fields
     Face and point fields did not propagate the information correctly
     and were treated as non-uniform volume fields of the wrong
     size. This should now be fixed
**** Division of =faceFields= causes division by zero
     The reason was that the patches of the divisor had a value of
     zero. This has been fixed by only dividing the
     =internalFields()=. Same for =pointFields=.
**** =valuePatches= did not work for mapped patches
     This kind of patch was not identified as something that could
     have the value fixed
**** Recent versions of 2.1.x break compilation of =CommonValueExpressionDriver.C=
     The definition of the operator =lessOp= clashed with another
     definition. Renamed.

     Fix provided by Bruno Santos
**** =expressionField= and =manipulateField= did not honor the =outputControl=-entry
     =expressionFields= were calculated at every time-step, even if
     the computational cost was high. Now if =outputControl= is
     =outputTime= the field is only calculated if it is going to be
     written
**** Double =namespace Foam= makes compilation of =groovyJump= fail with =icc=
     Seems like this one was overlooked because =gcc= is more
     tolerant towards stupidity.

     Reported by Edo Frederix
*** New Examples
**** Cases from the /OSCFD12/ Conference in London
     On the slides the case files were promised
*** New features
**** Access fields from different cases
     It is now possible for expression on =internalFields= to access
     fields from different cases. These fields are always read from
     disk when being accessed for the first time and stay cached in
     memory until the time is changed. The data is interpolated to the
     current mesh with the =meshToMesh=-class (which is the workhorse
     of the =mapFields=-utility)

     The meshes are stored in a repository and are accessed via a
     name. If for instance the mesh is known under the name
     =otherMesh= then in an expression the term =otherMesh(T)= is the
     field =T= from that other mesh at the specified time interpolated
     to the current mesh.

     Certain function objects and parser instances allow specifying
     foreign meshes in a subdictionary =foreignMeshes=.
**** Patch-expressions now support mapped-patches
     This is the long asked for feature to "get non-uniform values
     from other patches". It only works if the patches are specified
     as =mapped= (or =directMapped= for 1.x). Therefor a patch can
     only access one other patch with this.

     On a mapped patch =mapped(T)= gets field =T= from whatever this
     patch maps from (other patch, cells, faces). =mappedInternal(T)=
     gets the values from the internal cells on the other patch (this
     only works for patches).

     On a mapped patch an external variable expression for patches now
     changes its meaning: if =other= is the patch that the current
     patch maps from (and only then) then =var{patch'other}=expr=
     evaluates =expr= on the other patch and then maps the values to
     the current patch (=var= may be non-uniform). In all other
     circumstances =var= will get a uniform value which is derived
     from whatever =expr= evaluates to.

     To allow non-uniform =offsets= in the specification of mapped
     patches in =polyMesh/boundary= a utility
     =calcNonUniformOffsetsForMapped= was developed.
**** Function objects that manipulate time
     The framework for function objects that manipulate the =runTime=
     were added. The concrete implementations are
     - setDeltaTByTimeline :: set the timestep from a data file
     - setDeltaTWithPython :: set the timestep by evaluating a
          Python-snipplet that should return a floating point number
     - setEndTimeWithPython :: set the end time from the evaluation of
          a Python-snipplet
**** Plugin-functions for chemical model
     The library =libswakChemistryModelFunctionPlugin= adds the
     possibility to calculate properties of the chemistry like
     reaction rates, chemical timescale and released energy.

     Currently only implemented for =psiChemistryModel=

     If there is no chemistry model in memory it will be loaded and
     the reaction rates are calculated.

     There is a function =psiChem_updateChemistry= that forces the
     chemistry to be recalculated with a specified timestep. For
     technical reasons this returns a scalar field with the value
     $0$. So an expression like
     =psiChem_updateChemistry(0.0001)+psiChem_RR(CH4)= calculates the
     reaction rate assuming that the timestep is $0.0001$.

     Two additional functions that sum up all the reaction rates (this
     *should* be $0$) and sum up only positive reaction rates (giving
     an impression on what is going on)
**** Plugin-functions for radiation model
     The library =libswakRadiationModelFunctionPlugin= adds the
     possibility to calculate properties of the radiation like
     parts of the source terms =Rp= and =Ru= and the current
     radiation source

     If there is no radiation model in memory it will be loaded and
     the reaction rates are calculated. Assumes the presence of a
     temperature field called =T=.
*** Enhancements
**** Python-Integration now supports numpy-arrays
     If the =numpy=-library is found then global variables which are
     fields are being transformed to =numpy=-arrays. These arrays can
     be accessed with the usual =numpy=-array access like =a[i,j]= or
     =a[i,:]=. Global variables are made accessible *by
     reference*. This means that writing a value changes the global
     variable. Setting the whole variable has to be done by slicing
     =a[:]=3= (=a=3= removes it from the workspace). Vectors and
     tensors are two-dimensional arrays. They have
     convenience-attributes that return the whole vector of a
     component (like =a.x= for vectors or =a.xx= for tensors). To
     overwrite these they have to be sliced: =a.x[:]=0= (=a.x=0= only
     changes the attribute)

     If a variable that is going to a global namespace is a
     =numpy=-array then it is translated by the following rules:
     vectors are transformed to =scalarField=. Arrays with 3 columns
     to =vectorField=, 9 columns to =tensorField= and 6 columns to
     =symmTensorField=. Different column-numbers produce errors
**** Optional parameter =writeCode=/=writeFile= for =pythonIntegrationFunctionObject=
     If this is set then this Python-code is executed every time a
     time-step was written to disk
**** Python-integration has convenience-functions to create data files
     Python-integration now has two convenience-functions that return
     a filename with the full path and create the directories if
     necessary. The file is *not* created (that is the responsibility
     of the Python-code).

     The functions are (=name= is the name of the function object)
     - dataFile(fname) :: creates a directory
          =<case>/<name>_data/<time>=. To be used for data that is
          written at times that differ from write-time
     - timeDataFile(fname) :: creates a directory
          =<case>/<time>/<name>_data=. Should only be used for data
          that is written only at write-time
**** Switch off dimension checking in =funkyDoCalc=
     A command lione switch =-noDimensionChecking= is added that
     allows switching off the checking of dimensions if this makes
     expressions fail
**** =funkySetFields= allows accessing fields from another mesh
     If another case (with time and region) is specified via command
     line options (no dictionary) then in the expressions the other
     mesh can be accessed under the name =other=

     Main application for this is comparing to other cases (but also
     comparing different timesteps of the same case with each other).

     Used time is either fixed or set to the currently used (this can
     be selected via the command line)
**** =funkyDoCalc= allows specifying foreign meshes
     Each expression can specify foreign meshes with a
     =foreignMeshes=-subdict
**** Function objects to load and update foreign meshes
     There are two new function objects:
     - addForeignMeshes :: this allows specifying new foreign
          meshes. These can be used in subsequent function-objects or
          other swak-expressions on =internalFields=
     - foreignMeshesFollowTime :: this allows specifying a list of
          meshes whose time is set to the current time of the running
          case
**** =replaxTransientBC= outputs timestep
     This helps debugging timestepping-strategies
**** New accumulation =weightedAverage=
     A new possible entry for the =accumulations= calculates an
     average that is weighted by a facetor that depends on the entity:
     - cell volume if applicable
     - face area for surfaces etc
     - $1$ if there is no appropriate weight (usually values defined
       on points). The result is equivalent to =average=.
**** =expressionField= reports name and type of the created field
     The title says it all. Should give the user additional feedback
     about what is happening
**** New boundary condition =groovyPartialSlip= in =groovyStandardBCs=
     This boundary allows specifying the partial slip fraction of the
     regular =partialSlip=-BC with an expression.
**** =funkySetFields= allows switching off the correction of BCs
     This is sometimes necessary to allow calculations with fields
     where the boundary conditions have a lot of dependencies
     (turbulence model, other mesh etc)
**** Allow selection of additional regions in =funkySetFields=
     The option =-additionalRegions= allows selecting additional mesh
     regions for boundary conditions that require it (usually used
     together with =-preloadFields=).

     For the other case there is an additional option
     =-otherAdditionalRegions=.
**** Adding a =-preloadFields=-option to =funkySetFields=
     This option allows specifying additional field names to be
     preloaded in command line mode. If multiple mesh regions are
     specified (including another mesh)it will try to preload the
     field there too
**** =replayTransientBC= now supports all volume types
     Support for tensor-types has been added
**** =replayTransientBC= preloads fields
     For boundary conditions that require other fields these can be
     loaded into memory
**** =replayTransientBC= allows selection of time-steps
     The utility now allows the selection of timesteps. In that case
     it acts fundamentally different: instead of doing a timeloop it
     jumps to those times, calculates the boundary conditions and
     writes. The purpose of this mode is generating boundary fields
     for postprocessing.
*** Infrastructure
**** =Allwmake= stops if building of =swak4FoamParsers= fails
     As the majority of installation problems were actually problems
     with the compilation of the library =swak4FoamParsers= and as
     this library is central for all other things in =swak4Foam= the
     compilation terminates if this library is not built
**** Header =swak.H= with version information and macros
     This new header includes information about the
     =swak4Foam=-version, the =OpenFOAM=-version and macros for
     workarounds that depend on the OpenFOAM-version
**** =accumulations=-entries converted to =NamedEnums=
     This forces the entries to be checked while being read. Allowing
     more consistent treatment
**** Additional maintenance script for special python-versions
     This script allows compiling additional versions of
     =swakPythonIntegration= for cases where the version on the
     development machine is different from the version on the
     simulation machine (see installation chapter)
*** Cosmetics
    Changes without consequences for the user
**** Change type of =name= in parsers to =word=
     The valid characters for an identifier were the same as in =word=
     (was =string= before)
**** Updated contributor lists in =README= and sources
     The list of contributors to each file have been added (mostly by
     script with the information from the repository)
**** Rewritten methods that return pointers
     This abomination from the early days of =funkySetFields= has been
     cleaned
*** Documentation
    Changes to the documentation
**** Start of the reference-manual
     A first version of a reference manual is added. Only the first
     part about expressions and parameters is written.
** 2013-03-18 - version number : 0.2.3
*** Supports OpenFOAM 2.2
    This is the first version to compile with OpenFOAM 2.2

    Due to changes in OpenFOAM it requires several =#ifdef= (something
    that is usually avoided in the OpenFOAM-world) and other
    prepocessor definitions)
*** Incompatibilities to previous versions
**** =simpleFunctionObjects= and =simpleLagrangianFunctionObjects= no longer independent from rest
     Due to incompatibilities between OpenFOAM 2.2 and previous
     versions there are compatibility headers included from the rest
     of swak4Foam.

     Theoretically both libraries can be easily made independent again.
*** Bug fixes
**** Compiles on =1.6-ext= again
     The last release (0.2.2) did not compile on =1.6-ext=. This is
     fixed
**** Missing field files for the OSCFD2012-cases
     Due to a stupid =.hgignore= the =0.orig=-directories were
     missing. Nobody complained though
**** Did not compile on =2.0.x=
     This has been fixed
*** New features
**** Writing of sampled surfaces and sampled sets
     With the options =autoWriteSurface= and =autoWriteSets= sampled
     surfaces and sets are automatically written at each write
     time. With =writeSurfaceOnConstruction= and
     =writeSetOnConstruction= both are written when they are
     created. A format has to be specified. No values are written.
*** Enhancements
**** Parsers now support =eigenValues= and =eigenVectors=
     These function and some other minor ones (=sph=, =dev2=,
     =twoSymm=) are now supported by the parsers
**** Extract rows from tensors with component operator
     The component operators =.x=, =.y= and =.z= now extract the rows
     from a tensor
**** Variable names that are identical to fields trigger a Warning
     As this situation (like a variable named =p= for the position
     that shadows the pressure field =p=) leads to weird errors a
     warning is given. The warning can be switched of with the option
     =variableNameIdenticalToField=.
** 2013-05-24 - version number : 0.2.4
*** Incompatibilities to previous versions
**** Data directories now generated in folder =postProcessing= instead of case folder
     According to the convention introduced in OpenFOAM 2.2 now the
     data directories generated by functionObjects based on
     =simpleFunctionObjects= (that is almost all) and
     =swakPythonIntegration= (if the Python-code uses the
     =dataFile=-function) are generated as sub-directories of
     =postProcessing= in the case directory.

     Scripts that rely on the location of these files will have to be adapted
**** =ExpressionResult= from old versions are not correctly read
     This is due to a fix that now allows reading/writing these in
     binary mode. Only occurs if reading old data that either
     - uses a delayed variable
     - has global variables written in timesteps
**** Adaption of cases to 2.2
     This may break them for previous versions of OpenFOAM
*** Infrastructure
**** Additional flags for the compilation of the parsers
     The C-files generated by =bison= become very big and some
     compilers need quite long when aggressive optimization is
     used. An additional environment variable
     =SWAK_COMPILE_GRAMMAR_OPTION= allows the specification of
     additional compiler switches (like =-O1=) that will appear
     *after* the regular switches and should alter the behavior of
     the compiler. Set in =swakConfiguration= if you want to set this
     permanently
**** Use =bash= instead of =sh= in maintainance scripts
     Some distributions don't use good old =bash= as the default
     shell. This breaks some scripts in subtle and not so subtle ways
**** Build-script prints swak-version in the beginning
     To filter bug-reports with outdated versions
*** Cosmetics
    Changes without consequences for the user
**** Methods use =word= for names instead of =string=
     Methods that look for fields now use the appropriate data type
*** Bug fixes
**** Compilation on Fujitsu (and probably Intel) compilers
     There were template specializations for =pTraits= in
     =ExpressionResult.C= that had to be moved to =ExpressionResult.H=
     to allow compilation on these non-=gcc=-compilers
**** =executeIf=-function objects are executed if =readDuringConstruction= is set to =true=
     Even if the condition evaluates to =false= the function objects
     in the list are executed. This makes the run fail if the purpose
     of the condition was to guard from such a situation. Fixed
**** Expression results are not correctly read from binary file
     This was fixed by writing the fields properly with
     =writeValue=. This may introduce a little incompatibility when
     reading files written by old versions
**** Generated fields like =vol()= were registered
     These fields were registered with the mesh which might have
     disturbed similar named /real/ fields. Also did the fields
     generated for variables get registered
**** Missing files in =potentialPitzDaily=-case
     Missing initial conditions made this case a bit pointless
**** =log(vol())= gives floating point exception
     This was due to the boundaries being set to 0. Fixed. Also for
     the =dist()= function
*** New features
**** Library with additional =searchableSurfaces=
     The library =simpleSearchableSurfaces= adds more searchable
     surfaces to be used in =snappyHexMesh=. Types of surfaces in
     that library are
     - some objects that duplicate existing surfaces and are only
       there for historical reasons (except the cylinder which
       distinguishes between different sides). Others wrap existing
       surfaces and expose the different sides
     - wrappers for other surfaces that do coordinate transformations
       with it: rotation, translation, scaling
     - wrappers that take two surfaces and do boolean operations with
       them: union, intersection, difference, exclusive difference
     - Some wrappers that manipulate the regions of a surface: rename
       them, collect them into one region
**** New variable type =StackedExpressionResult=
     This type is used to collect multiple values. If it is assigned
     a value then the *uniform* value of the right hand side is
     appended to the variable. Useful for collecting multiple values
     for output.

     Variant =StoredStackExpresionResult= keeps the values between
     timesteps and allows the collection of timeline data
**** Function object =dumpGlobalVariable=
     Dumps the value of a global variable into a line of a file
**** Function object =removeGlobalVariable=
     Removes a global variable (mainly used to preserve memory)
**** Optional entry =aliases= for parser specifications
     This dictionary allows the specification of alias names and
     their real names. If an alias name is found in an expression
     then it is replaced by the real name when looking for
     fields. The application for this is that OpenFOAM allows
     characters in field names that are not valid in swak-names and
     would break the grammar if they were (for instance =-= or
     =:=). By setting an alias such fields can still be accessed.
**** Function object to dump registered objects
     The function object =listRegisteredObjects= in the
     =simpleFunctionObjects= lists all the objects currently
     registered with the mesh. Mainly used for debugging ("Which
     fields are currently available?")
**** Function object that only executes its children if the run is serial/parallel
     The new functionObject =executeIfParallelSerial= allows
     specifying if a list of function objects should only be run if
     the simulation is running in serial or parallel.
**** Function objects to calculate distributions
     There are now four function objects that calculate distributions
     of fields. Distributions are calculated based on the
     =Distribution=-class that is part of OpenFOAM starting from
     version 2.0 and uses a weighting for added values. There are two
     kinds of output
     - a timeline with the key characteristics of the distribution
     - directories with the distributions at specific times. These
       are written "raw" and accumulated
     For tensors and vectors these are output separately for every
     component.  These outputs can be switched on and off
     separately. The user has to specify the bin-width for the
     classification. If the bin-width is too small and the
     distribution becomes too small it is scaled down.

     The two function-objects in the =simpleFunctionObjects= are:
     - fieldDistribution :: distribution of field values weighted by
          the cell volume
     - patchFieldDistribution :: distribution of a field on a number
          of patches weighted by the face area
     In =swakSimpleFunctionObjects= the two functionObjects are:
     - swakExpressionDistribution :: distribution of an =expression=
          on some entity. The user also has to specify and expression
          =weight= with the weight of each value and a logical
          expression =mask=. Values are only used if =mask= is =true=
          at the place
     - patchExpressionDistribution :: distribution of =expression= on
          a number of patches. As the weight the face-area is used
*** Enhancements
**** Global variables now can be subclasses of =ExpressionResult=
     This allows other variable types like stored variables to be
     inserted there. They are also now saved for restarting
**** =endTime= now added to Python-wrapper
     All classes using the python interpreter now have a variable
     =endTime= with the current end-time value
**** Force write if =endTime= set by time-manipulation is reached
     If one of the functionObjects for time-manipulation set the
     end-time and it is reached and this is no time for output a
     complete output of the fields is forced
**** Function-objects based on =patch= from the =simpleFunctionObjects= now accept regular expression
     This includes the =patchExpression=-functionObject. The supplied
     list is now interpreted as a list of regular expressions and all
     patches that match are included and processed
**** More flexible output control for functionObjects based on =simpleFunctionObjects=
     An optional parameter =outputControlMode= now allows control on
     when the function object will be executed. Possible values are:
     - timestep :: Every =outputInterval= timesteps the object will
                   be executed. This is the default behaviour with an
                   interval $1$
     - deltaT :: Approximately every =outputDeltaT= times it will be
                 executed. The nearest possible timestep is used
     - outputTime :: Executed whenever a regular output is scheduled
**** =swakDataEntry= improved
     Two enhancements
     - the name of the independent variable  no can be
       specified. This variable holds the value that is passed to the
       data entry as a uniform value
     - data entry can now be integrated. This allows using it for
       instance for the injection rate in lagrangian models
** 2014-01-24 - version number : 0.3.0
   The reason for the jump in the minor revision number is that with
   the introduction of the parser for lagrangian particles (=cloud=)
   the last white spot as far as major data structures in OpenFOAM is
   "explored"
*** Incompatibilities to previous versions
**** Support of /old/ =1.6-ext= lost
     Due to certain differences this version only compiles with the
     =nextRelease=-branch of 1.6-ext (from the =git=).Usually the
     failing parts can be fixed b commenting out the appropriate
     =#define= in =Libraries/swak4FoamParsers/include/swak.H=.
*** New supported versions
**** Added support for Foam 3.0
     As this version is quite similar to 1.7 a lot of =#ifdefs= were
     introduced by this port leading to a possible unification with
     the 1.x-branch
*** Infrastructure
**** Make error messages in =Allwmake= more verbose
     The error messages where already quite verbose. But people
     didn't understand them and asked the same questions over and
     over ...
**** =simpleFunctionObjects= no longer considered an independent project
     As there are going to be more cross-dependencies the
     =simpleFunctionObjects= now have to be part of swak. Changes to
     the compile-scripts reflect this.
**** =Allwmake= makes sure that swak is compiled for the same installation
     The script writes the version it is used with to disk and at
     later compiles that this is the same (this makes sure that not a
     wrong version is used inadvertently to compile)
**** Additional macros for Debugging output
     There are two macros defined that inside an object write the name
     of the class and the address of the object (if debug is
     enabled). This makes the output easier distinguishable from the
     output from other classes/objects. The two macros are:
     - Dbug :: Writes the debug information *only* on the master processor
     - Pbug :: Writes the output on all processors and for parallel
               runs prefixes the processor number
     Both macros are to be used like regular streams and don't have
     to be enclosed in =if(debug){}= (this is part of the macro)
**** Separate option for compiling the output of =flex=
     With some compilers (Intel) and aggressive optimization the
     lexers (whose code is generated by =flex=) have uninitialized
     memory and segmentation faults. In these cases now an environment
     variable =SWAK_COMPILE_LEXER_OPTION= to set lower optimization
     for these compilers. For example:
: export SWAK_COMPILE_LEXER_OPTION=-O0
     After that recompile
**** Fixing race condition with big =WM_NCOMPPROCS=
     For some machines race conditions with compiling the main library
     has been reported. The reason seems to be that some source files
     need headers generated while compiling the grammar. If due to the
     large number of simultaneous compilation processes the headers
     have not been generated when these files are compiled the
     compilation fails.

     This effect could not be reproduced on the development machine
     (but that doesn't mean that this doesn't happen on some
     machines). Nevertheless for the libraries where this might be the
     case the number of compilation jobs is limited to the number
     grammars in the library.

     Better solution to let the =Allwmake=-script generate the headers
     before the regular =wmake= starts.
**** Updates to Debian-packaging
     Several minor additions that should make packaging easier
     - Package version now gets the correct distro name (at least on Ubuntu)
     - Packaging picks up the correct python-version (2.7 or 2.6
       ... does anyone use older?)
     - Packaging process leaves the =swakVersion.H= alone
*** Documentation
    Important enhancements of the documentation in the
    =Documentations=-folder
**** Documentation of =accumulations=
     The possible values of the common =accumulations=-lists are
     documented
**** General documentation of the Python-embedding
     The general options and the behavior of the Python-embedding are
     described
*** Incompatibilities to previous versions
**** =outputControlMode= =timestep= renamed to =timeStep=
     Because of report
     https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=177
     to be consistent with the nomenclature in the 'regular'
     function-objects.
*** Bug fixes
**** Missing =timeSet= in function-objects
     This method has been added in 2.2.x and breaks the compilation
     of several function-objects

     Fix developed by Bruno Santos
**** =sourceImplicit= unstable
     For some reason using =SuSp= gave unstable results for the
     PDE-functionObjects. Changed to =Sp=
**** Fixed bug were only one =swakCoded= worked at a time
     Bug originally reported
     https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=179
     in. Reason was that the variable describing the type was not
     correctly set.
**** Incorrectly read entries in =swakCoded=
     The entries =codeEnd= and =codeExecute= were not correctly read
     but instead the entry =codeRead= was read. Fixed
**** No logical variables found by most parsers
     Reported as
     https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=172

     Only the field parser correctly found logical variables (although
     they were stored). Added a method to pick up the variables (the
     reason why this part was commented out is that there is no such
     thing as a =volBoolField= and that is what the regular mechanism
     expected)
**** =sampledSurface= not correctly updated at time of write
     Reported as
     https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=176

     In that case the driver was written before the surface was
     updated thus generating fields of size $0$. Now =update= is
     called at various places (to make sure it is called in any instance)
**** =sumMag=-accumulation now working
     This accumulation was available but not implemented. Now implemented.

     For non-scalar types it is calculated separately for each component
**** Calculation of weight fields failed if size on one processor was $0$
     This was due to a logical error that was propagated through
     mindless copy/paste (only the Field-driver got it right). Fixed
**** =groovyTotalPressure= does not read =value=
     Because it is not initialized from the superclass when the
     dictionary constructor is used. Fixed
**** For multiple times the option =addDummyPhi= makes =funkySetFields= crash
     Because the pointer is already set. Fixed
**** =aliases= not constructed from dictionary
     If the dictionary was read after the construction the aliases
     are not read. Fixed by moving this reading to the tables reading
     which is used in every time a dictionary is involved
**** Gravity not correctly passed in =evolveXXCloud=
     Passed a value where a reference would have been needed. Fixed
**** =writeOften= writes all the time
     Reason for this was a change of the interface of =outputTime= not
     being propagated to this function-object. Fixed
**** Python-integration does not return single scalars as uniform
     The Python-integration returned single scalars (and vectors) not
     as a single value but as a field of length $1$. This caused
     warnings that messed up the output. Fixed
**** =basicSource= working again for OF 2.1
     These were not compiled by accident. Fixed
**** =faceZone= and =faceSet= do not correctly work on parallel runs
     As reported in
     http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=190
     if a face-set or zone has faces on a processor boundary incorrect
     values were produced.

     The reason was that boundary faces are treated like internal
     faces. Also do these faces exist on both processors. This is now
     fixed. If the face is on a regular boundary patch the value is
     used. If on a processor patch the value is only used if it is on
     the owner processor.
**** Allow user to override =notImplemented= in =movePoints= and =moveMesh= of function objects
     This addresses
     http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=190

     Subclasses of =simpleFunction=-objects are not guaranteed to be
     parallel-aware (for instance =swakExpression= can have problems
     with stored variables if the number of cells/faces changes) so
     the =notImplemented= can't be removed for good.

     The workaround is a rather verbose error message and the
     possibility to override =notImplemented= with a dictionary-switch
*** New features
**** Function object that executes if the OpenFOAM-version is right
     The functionObject =executeIfOpenFOAMVersionBiggerEqual= only
     executes if the OpenFOAM-version is bigger or equal to a
     specified version. The arguments =majorVersion= and
     =minorVersion= are required. If =patchVersion= is not specified
     it will match any version. A =git= version (=.x=) will match any
     patch-version
**** Function object that is only executed if the current time is the =startTime=
     The function object =executeIfStartTime= executes its children
     if the current time is the =startTime= from the =controlDict=
     (which isn't necessarily the first time step in a restarted case)
**** Function object that calculates the potential flow
     To be used on an existing field to set reasonable initial
     conditions
**** Function object that forces a recalculation of =phi=
     Named =recalcPhi= in the simpleFunctionObjects. Usually needed
     when some other functionObject manipulates velocity or density
**** Function object that corrects thermophysical model
     Name =correctThermo=. Recalculates the thermophysical
     model. To be used after manipulating temperature etc
**** Function objects that recalculate the energy of a thermophysical model
     Recalculate enthalpy, sensible enthalpy or internal energy
     according to the current temperature. This allows making this
     consistent if the temperature has been manipulated.

     For OpenFOAM after 2.2 these are replaced by one that
     recalculates the energy or enthalpy
**** Function object that calculates the average of one variable as a function of another
     The function object =swakExpressionAverageDistribution=
     calculates the average of one function (the =expression=) as a
     distribution over another (the =abscissa=). An example would be
     the average pressure in x-direction with =abscissa= being
     =pos().x=, =expression= being just =p= and the =weight=
     being =vol()=. The weight has to be a scalar. All other
     expressions can be any data-type
**** New utility =fieldReport=
     This utility prints some quantitative statistics about a
     specified field. Optionally these statistics can also be printed
     for patches, sets and zones. The data can be written to a
     CSV-file. Also the distributions of the field can be written.
**** New utility =funkyPythonPostproc=
     This utility needs a dictionary and a specification of
     times. For each time it
     - loads a list of fields specified in the dictionary
     - executes a list of function objects specified in the dictionary
     - executes python-scripts
     The idea is that the function objects pass data to the
     python-scripts via global variables and the python-scripts do
     whatever they like
**** New utility =funkySetLagrangianParticle=
     This utility allows setting new fields of a lagrangian
     cloud. Like =funkySetFields= it has two modes:
     - Setting one field over the command line. This is triggered by
       the =-field=-option
     - Using a dictionary to specify what is being set. In this mode
       more than one field and more than one cloud can be set. In this
       mode there is also the possibility to specify a *new*
       cloud. This mode expects variables in global namespaces. On of
       these variables is the position of the particles, for the other
       variables fields of the same name will be created. All the
       variables have to be of the same size. Data where corresponding
       particle position is outside the mesh is discarded
*** Enhancements
**** Additional parser for lagrangian particles
     There is now an additional parser to calculate expressions on
     particles.

     This parser is organized in a separate library
     =libswakLagrangianParser= that has to be loaded to use this
     parser.

     Depending on whether the cloud in question is already in memory
     or on disk the data is handled differently:
     - if the data is on disc then the basic properties of the cloud
       (particle positions etc) are used to initialize the class. Then
       all files in the folder of the cloud are read and made
       available as field names that are the same as the
       file-names. Characters in the file names that are not
       compatible with the parser are replaced and created as
       aliases. In this mode =swak= has no idea about the data except
       the name and the type
     - if the cloud is in memory then a corresponding proxy object is
       sought. This proxy object knows which data the cloud has, what
       the type is and a short description. It makes the data
       available as fields.

       =swak= has by default proxy objects for most particle classes
       that come with =OpenFOAM=. For unsupported classes and adaptor
       library has to be written.
     When a parser for a cloud is used for the first time a table of
     all the available fields is printed to the screen with type and
     description (if available)
**** Function objects that calculate PDEs can use fields from memory
     If the field is found in memory this is used instead of a file
     read from disc.
**** Function objects that calculate PDEs can write fields before solving
     An additional switch =writeBeforeAfter= allows writing the field
     before and after solving
**** simpleFunctionObjects have addition =outputControlMode=
     Mode =startup= executes the FO only during construction
**** Conditional functionObjects now have optional =else=
     It is now possible to add a sub-dictionary =else= that is used
     to initialize a =functionObjectProxy= that is executed if the
     condition is *not* fulfilled. The sub-dictionary inherits all
     settings that are not set from the parent-dictionary
**** =swakCoded= now allows addition of data to functionObject
     The entry =codeData= is now read and inserted into the functionObject
**** Parsers in =swakFiniteArea= no also have complete tensor-operations
     The two parsers in that library now also support the complete
     set of tensor operations (like =eigenValues= etc)
**** =swakExpressionDistribution= now allows non-scalar weights
     For expressions whose results is not a scalar now the weight
     function can either be a scalar or of the same type as the
     expression (so every component can have a separate weight)
**** More options for =accumulations=
     A number of possible accumulations have been added. Most of
     these are based on distributions. If the =weighted= variant is
     chosen then the meaning is the more physical one (for =weighted=
     the 'natural' weight of the quantity is used. For instance for
     cells the cell volume. Otherwise the weight $1$ is used). Some
     of these accumulations need a single floating point number as a
     parameter. This is simply added to the name. The added
     accumulations are:
     - weightedSum :: sum of the quantity times the weight. There is
                      an alias =integrate= for this
     - median :: The value for which 50% of the distribution are
                 smaller than this. More robust alternative to
                 =average=
     - quantile :: =quantile0.25= for instance is the value for which
                   25% of the distribution are smaller than it
     - range :: The difference of the quantile of $\frac{1+f}{2}$ and
                $\frac{1-f}{2}$. For instance =range0.9= gives the
                range in which 90% of the values are (from the quantile
                5% to 95%)
     - smaller :: The fraction of the distribution that is smaller
                  than a given value
     - bigger :: The inverse of =smaller=
     - size :: The size of the underlying entity (usually number of
               cells, faces, points). For types with more than one
               components all the components have the same value
     - weightSum :: Sum of the weights of the underlying
                    entity. Usually the volume oder the area of it.
**** Python code files are now searched more flexible
     If a file specified with an option like =startFile= in a
     Python-functionObject (or similar) is not found in the current
     directory the path of the dictionary it is specified in is
     prepended and the file is searched there
**** Python integration now uses =IPython= if possible
     The interactive shell of the python integration now uses
     =IPython= if it is installed. This improves tab-completion etc
**** Preload libraries in the Python integration
     As problematic libraries could hand during importing these
     libraries can be imported in a safe way using the optional
     =importLibs=-entry which is a dictionary. The keys are the names
     under which the imports will appear in the Python-namespace. The
     value is optional and the name of the actual library
**** Added standard function =weight()=
     All parsers now implement a function =weight()= that returns the
     "natural" weight that is used for instance in the weighted
     average (for internal fields that would be for instance the cell
     volume)
**** =funkyDoCalc= now writes files
     Two kinds of files are optionally written
     - CSV-files with the values of an evaluation (each evaluation
       gets its own file)
     - Distributions of the evaluations (in a separate directory for
       each time)
     All the files go into a directory whose name is derived from the
     name of the evaluation. The outputs can be switched on with the
     options =writeDistributions= and =writeCsv=. Either
     - from the command line: this switches it on for *all* evaluations
     - one "per dictionary"-basis for each evaluation separately
**** PDE-functionObjects now relax their equations
     The PDE-functionObjects now honor the =relaxationFactors. If
     =steady= is =false= then relaxation has to be switched on using
     =relaxUnsteady=. For the last corrector iteration the equation
     is not relaxed unless the parameter =relaxLastIteration= is set.
**** Full set of =laplacian=-operations in =internalField=-parser
     The support of =laplacian= operations (especially with a
     coefficient that is different from a scalar) was incomplete. Now
     all possible coefficient types are supported.

     Also in the =fvcSchemes=-plugin functions the set of
     =laplacian=-operators was completed
**** Function object =swakExpression= now has optional =mask=
     If the logical expression =mask= is set then only the results
     from =expression= for which =mask= is =true= are used for
     accumulations
*** Examples
**** Moved the OSCFD-examples to a different directory
     Started one new directory for all cases from presentations
**** Added examples from the swak-training at the 8th Workshop
     Two new examples
     - sandPitsOfCarcoon :: Reenacting a scene from "Return of the
          Jedi" with =twoPhaseEulerFoam=
     - landspeedersInCanyon :: Simulating two landspeeders from "A new
          hope" with =simpleFoam=
** 2014-07-11 - version number : 0.3.1
*** Incompatibilities to previous versions
**** Additional required code snipplet for some Python-functionObjects
     There is now a new code-snipplet required for a number of these
     function objects. It can be left empty but has to be specified
**** Dimension required for stuff in =swakSourceFields=
     The expressions used with =swakExplicitSource=,
     =swakImplicitSource= and =swakSetValue= now also need a
     dimension. This dimension is used to make sure that the user
     "knows" the actual dimensions of his source terms
*** New supported versions
**** Added support for OpenFOAM 2.3
     This version adds support for OpenFOAM 2.3. The major changes
     were due to changes in the API to
     - =searchableSurface=
     - =meshToMesh=
     And several minor adaptions
**** Added support for Foam-Extend 3.1
     No major changes required. Runtime-selection tables are now
     sorted too
*** Infrastructure
**** Improved macros for Foam versions
     This should make =swak.H= more readable
**** Support for private installation of bison
     If a directory =privateRequirements/bin= is private in the
     sources directory then the =bison= found there is used. A script
     =maintainanceScripts/compileRequirements.sh= is provided that
     fetches the bison sources, compiles them and installs them there
*** Documentation
**** Information about macro-expansion added
     A section about thus new feature is added
*** Bug fixes
**** Invalid entries in distributions from =swakExpressionAverageDistribution=
     The distribution data was not clipped to the range where actually
     data was collected. This is now fixed by adding the notion of an
     invalid value to =SimpleDistribution=
**** =swakExpressionAverageDistribution= not correctly working in parallel
     This should now be fixed
**** =fvOptions= in =swakSourceFields= now actually working
     Because of the missing dimensions until now =swakExplicitSource=
     and =swakImplicitSource= were not actually working
**** =fvOptions= did not honor the =selectionMode=-entry
     Always set source etc for whole region. Now the =selectionMode=
     is honored (for instance only in =cellZone= the source term will
     be applied.)
**** =patchFunctionObject= fails for some parallel runs
     Problem is that when the processor boundaries are used too that
     the indexing might be inconsistent on the different
     processors. Fix: coupled boundaries are ignored by default (have
     to be switched on)
**** =funkyPythonPostproc= not executing function objects
     In newer version the =execute()=-method of function objects
     needs a parameter =force=. Fixed
**** Temporary fields shadow 'real' fields in =foam-extend-3.1=
     Due to a small semantic difference in the copy constructor of
     =GeometricField= a temporary object of the same name shadows the
     real field and prohibits that it is written. Fixed by giving the
     copy a unique name
*** New features
**** Boundary condition =groovyFixedNormalSlip= in =groovyStandardBCs=
     These boundary conditions allow specifying a value in normal
     direction to the patch while in tangential direction the regular
     slip condition is applied. This is implemented for =fvPatch= and
     =pointPatch=. For the =pointPatch= the normal direction has to be
     specified by the user
**** New utility =funkyWarpMesh=
     Utility that calculates new point values for the mesh. In the
     simplest form the expression is specified on the command line. If
     the option =-expression= is missing the program looks for a
     dictionary which allows more control. If =-relative= is specified
     points are moved by the result of the expression. The result of
     the expression must be a =pointVectorField=
**** Function objects that write additional writes depending on the flow conditions
     A hierarchy of function objects that trigger additional
     writes. Once a condition is fulfilled data is either written for
     a specified interval or as long as the condition is
     fulfilled. After that a cooldown period is possible. During this
     period nothing is written.

     The concrete function objects are
     - writeIfFieldOutside :: writing is triggered if the minimum or
	  the maximum of a field is outside a specified range. Part of
          the =simpleFunctionObjects=
     - writeIfSwakExpression :: writing is triggered if a logical
          expression evaluates to =true=. Stopping and retriggering is
          also possible with logical expressions. Part of
          the =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=
     - writeIfPython :: writing is triggered by a Python-snipplet that
                        either returns =True= or =False=. Stopping and
                        retriggering are also possible. Part of
                        =swakPythonIntegration=

     Allows saving and writing a specifiable number of timesteps
     *before* the condition is met (this allows finding out what lead
     to this)
**** Function object =writeOldTimesOnSignal= with new signal handlers
     This function object installs a new signal handler for specified
     signals.

     The function object itself saves the last $N$-timesteps, the
     signal handler (when called) writes these steps to disk and then
     calls the regular OpenFOAM signal handler
**** New library with =fvOptions=
     Starting with OpenFOAM 2.2 (where the concept of =fvOptions= was
     introduced) there is an additional library =swakFvOptions= with
     special =fvOptions= (in addition to those in =swakSourceFields=):
     - executeFunctionObjectsFvOption :: this one does not manipulate
          the fields (as expected) but "only" runs a list of function
          objects. Application is for instance to get information
          during the time-step for algorithms that have multiple
          iterations in a time-step
     - reportAvailableFvOptions :: Does no manipulation of the
          solution/equations. Simply reports that a callback has been
          called. Application: find out which =fvOption=-calls are
          used by a solver in which order without going through the
          sources
     - reportMatrix :: Does not manipulate the matrix but prints a
                       number of metrics
**** Macro expansion
     For expressions and variable lists there is now the possibility
     to expand values from the dictionary during reading. The two
     characters that trigger this are
     - $ :: like the regular variable lookup in OpenFOAM.In its most
            complex form it looks like this =$[(type)spec]= where
            =spec= specifies where to look for the value (including
            scoping if the OpenFOAM-version supports it). The optional
            =type= specifies how the entry should be interpreted
     - # :: in variable lists: =#otherList;= includes the variable
            list =otherList= instead of this entry
     These expansions allow the construction of reusable snipplets
     that include information from other parts of the case. For
     instance (this is only part of the specification)
: #include "$FOAM_CASE/constant/g"
: vecName U;
: downComponent (
:     "grav=$[(dimensionedVector)g];"
:     "down=($vecName & grav)/mag(grav);"
: );
: variables (
:     "#downComponent;"
:     "maxDown=max(mag(down));"
: );
     would calculate the component of a vector field that points in
     the direction of the gravity (as specified in the =g=-file).

     This expansion is done during the expression.
*** Enhancements
**** =expressionField= now allows setting of dimensions
     An optional entry =dimension= for the function object now allows
     setting the dimension of the resulting field
**** New function =distToPatch= in Field-parser
     This function gives the distance in the mesh to a specified face.

     Not yet working correctly
**** =panicDump= now allows storing old values
     With the switch =storeAndWritePreviousState= this functionObject
     now can cache a number of timesteps and write these results in
     addition to the current timestep
**** =swakExpressionAverageDistribution= records extremes and number of samples
     In addition to the average now this Function object also records
     the minimum and maximum value for each bin. Also the number of
     samples used in the bin
**** Python-function objects that return a boolean now have a initialization-snipplet
     The function objects =executeIfPython=, =setDeltaTWithPython=,
     =setEntTimeWithPython= and =writeAndEndWithPython= now expect
     code snipplet named =init=. This is executed in the beginning and
     can be used to set up global variables if these snipplets need
     some kind of state. The variables have to be declared =global= in
     the snipplets that do the actual decision (for technical reason)
**** =fvOptions=-support in PDE-function objects
     The function objects =solveTransportPDE= and =solveLaplacianPDE=
     now call the regular =fvOptions=-callbacks (this allows modifying
     the solution in the same way it can be modified for solvers)
*** Examples
**** =other/simpleBendedPipe=
     Example to demonstrate =funkyWarpMesh= and post-processing on
     bended geometries
** 2015-05-31 - version number : 0.3.2
   This is the last release to support OpenFOAM 1.7.x and older
*** Future changes
    These are things that will happen in the *next* release and will
    break backwards-compatibility
**** Discontinuation of the =1.x=-branch
     As version =1.7= is several years old this release will be the
     last release that supports it.

     Starting with this release the =port_2.x=-branch will become the
     =default= branch and the =1.x= will become =legacy=
**** Fixing examples
     Due to the umber of different supported Foam-versions not all the
     examples run on all versions and it is not possible to fix them
     in such a way that they work on all versions. In the next version
     they will by adapted to use the =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= utility as
     this supports having different Foam versions in one case. As a
     consequence most cases won't run without an installed =PyFoam=
*** Incompatibilities
**** Changed behavior of =groovyBC= during initialization
     If =value= is unset then during initialization the value of the
     internal field next to the patch is used. Previous behavior was
     to set the patch to $0$.

     In most cases the new behavior should be better.
**** Changed semantics for boolean values in =internalField=
     As OpenFOAM does not support geometric fields of type boolean
     swak uses scalar fields for storing truth values (only in the
     =internalField=-parser). The semantics was that a value of =0=
     means =false=. Everything else =true=. Logical operators set
     =true= to $1$ and =false= to $0$. As the test for equality to $0$
     may sometimes fail this semantics is changed slightly: values
     $>\frac{1}{2}$ are interpreted as =true=. All others as =false=.

     If operators were used properly this should not matter, but
     expressions that assume for instance that =0.1= is =true= will
     now fail. Overall this change improves the stability of logival
     expressions
**** Better detection of single values
     The improved detection of single values might break some
     expressions. Especially for the Python-integration as values that
     were previously passed as arrays are now being passed as single
     values
**** Parser for kinematic parcels replaces =minParticleMass= with =minParcelMass=
     This reflects a change in the API of the kinematic lagrangian
     parcels. The old function has been discontinued to avoid
     confusions with changed semantics
**** =SIGTERM= automatically switched on for parallel runs in =writeOldTimesOnSignal=
     For parallel runs this signal is now automatically switched in so
     that other signals are propagated to other processors
**** Changed bin-with in =swakExpressionAverageDistribution=
     Due to a different calculation automatically calculated
     bin-widths in this function object might slightly differ from
     previous calculations
**** =funkyPythonPostproc= writes function object data to a different directory
     For the swak-function objects the data is now written to a
     directory whose name is based on the input dictionary instead of
     =postProcessing=.

     This might break scripts and other post-processing procedures
     that rely on the data being in =postProcessing=.

     Data generated during the run-time of the solver is unaffected
*** New supported versions
**** Added support for Foam-Extend 3.2
     Only minor adaptions. Mainly to accommodate the new debug switches
**** Added support for OpenFOAM 2.4.0
     Compiles with OpenFOAM 2.4.0 (and 2.4.x)
*** Internals (for developers)
**** Type of booleans changed for =internalField=
     Results that were booleans used to report =bool= as their type
     for the =internalField=-parser. Now they report
     =volLogicalField=, =surfaceLogicalField= or
     =pointLogicalField=. This makes them consistent with the
     possibility of requesting these start symbols and specifying
     logical fields in the parameters of a plugin function
*** Bug fixes
**** =swakExpressionAverageDistribution= fails for small spans
     If the span of the =abscissa= is too small (almost $0$) there
     were numeric problems. In this case the bin-width is now extended
     to $1$
**** Quantile calculations (including =median=) not correctly working in parallel
     Reason was that =SimpleDistribution.calcScalarWeight= did not
     =reduce=. This is now fixed (and a special switch is introduced
     for one situation where this isn't desirable)
**** =PDE=-function objects broken because of =fvOptions=
     On OpenFOAM-versions with =fvOptions= these were broken because
     of inconsistent dimensions.

     This is fixed: now if a =fvOption= is defined the
     function-objects also needs =rho= and this is passed to the call
     of =fvOption= when generating the source term
**** Restart in =binary= not working (with global variables)
     As reported in
     https://sourceforge.net/p/openfoam-extend/ticketsswak4foam/225/

     Problem seems to be that the =HashPtrTable= is not correctly read
     in =binary=-mode. Workaround is to switch to =ascii= before
     writing and reading that table and then switch back to the
     original mode
**** Single values were passed as arrays
     Single values like =min(expr)= were passed as arrays instead of a
     single value. This is now fixed. The problem is that now
     expressions that rely on the old behavior might break
**** Distributions not written if there is only a single bin
     If all data falls into one bin of the distribution then the
     distribution was not written. This is now fixed
**** =weightedAverage= for =AccumulationCalculation= fails for zero-size fields
     Fixed
**** =writeOldTimesOnSignal= fails with =writeCurrent=
     If the current time was already written (because it is part of
     the stored times) a segmentation fault occurred. This has been
     fixed by checking whether the current time is already stored
**** Turbulence plugin-functions did not correct the boundary field
     This has been fixed
**** Some =maintainanceScripts= do not work under Python 3
     The scripts
     - =makeSwakVersionFile.py=
     - =makeCopyrightEntries.py=
     have been adapted so that they now work with Python 2.x as well
     as Python 3
**** Function =distToPatch= now working
     This function for the field parser gives the distance in the mesh
     to a specified patch. /Distance/ is defined as minimial sum of
     cell-to-face distances needed to reach this cell from the named
     patch
**** Not all =processorX= written in =writeTimesOnSignal=
     If a =SIGSEGV= or =SIGFPE= were encountered only on some
     processors then on the others no data was written because these
     signals do not propagate to other processors

     Now the signal handler raises a =SIGTERM= which is propagated to
     the other processors. For parallel runs a signal handler for
     =SIGTERM= is automatically set up to make sure that on all
     remaining processors data is written
*** Infrastructure
**** Script for generating releases
     Provided by Alexey Matveichev

     The script =maintainanceScripts/make-releases.sh= rolls a release
     and puts it into the directory =releases=
**** Automatic =swakConfiguration=
     Provided by Alexey Matveichev

     Automatically finds the linking options for Python with
     =python-config=
*** New features
**** Additional distance-functions in field-parser
     Similar to =distToPatch= there are now two additional built-in
     functions:
     - distToCells :: A logical field is provided. The distance to the
                      cells for which this field is =true= is
                      calculated
     - distToFaces :: Same as =distToCells= but with a logical
                      function for the faces
     Both functions return cell-values
**** New function-plugin =swakMeshWaveFunctionPlugin= for mesh related distances etc
     This library collects functions that are similar to
     =distFromPath=: they use the =MeshWave=-algorithm to calculate
     distances and connectivity of the mesh.

     Functions in this plugin are:
     - meshLayersFromPatch :: Calculates for each cell how many mesh
          layers it is away from a patch
     - meshLayersFromCells :: Calculates the number of layers from a
          set of cells selected by a logical expression
     - meshLayersFromFaces :: Calculates the number of layers from a
          set of faces selected by a logical expression
     - floodFillFromCells :: Number connected regions. Cells selected
          by a logical expression separate these regions
     - floodFillFromFaces :: Number connected regions. Faces selected
          by a logical expression separate these regions
     - cellColouring :: "Colors" the cells in such a way that no two
                        neighboring cells have the same number. Mainly
                        for visualizing the mesh
                        structure. "Neighboring" means "cells sharing
                        a face" not an edge. Therefor it may look at
                        the surface like there are cells with the same
                        color
**** Additional function in =swakMeshQualityFunctionPlugin=
     Additional functions:
     - mqCellFaceNr :: Number of faces for each cell
     - mqCellShape :: Field with numbers describing the cell
                      shape. Values are:
       - 1 :: Hex
       - 2 :: Prism
       - 3 :: Wedge
       - 4 :: Pyramid
       - 5 :: Tetraeder wedge
       - 6 :: Tetraeder
       - 0 :: no classification. Polygon
**** Function object for developers that raises a signal at the defined time
     The function object =provokeSignal= can be used to debug signal
     handling. No other possible use is known.

     The function object allows defining the signal, the time and - in
     case of parallel runs - the processors on which the signal should
     be raised
**** New function-object =executeIfSetOrZone= that only executes if sets or zones are present
     This function object executes a lost of function objects if
     face/cell/point sets or zones are present. The required zones and
     sets are specified in a dictionary =setsAndZones=: keys are the
     names of the entities the values are the types (like
     =faceZone=). Only if *all* objects specified there are present
     the function objects are executed.

     As a side effect if =loadAndCacheMissingSets= is =true= than sets
     that are not yet found in memory are loaded from
     disk. *Attention*: if no set of that name is found on disk then
     it is searched at every time-step. This is a potential
     performance problem (it is not a problem if the set is there)
**** New function object =executeIfPatch= that only executes if patches are present
     This function object executes a lost of function objects if
     a list of patches is present.
**** Function object =listMeshData= displays data stored in mesh
     This function object shows data that is stored in the
     mesh. Mostly =solverPerformance= with the residuals of the linear
     solvers
**** Function object =solverPerformanceToGlobalVariables=
     This function object gets a list of =fieldNames= and gets the
     information about their solver performances. The three quantities
     that it gets are
     - =nIterations= :: the number of iterations
     - =initialResidual= :: residual before iterating
     - =finalResidual= :: residual after iterating
     For each value three variables are created (assuming the field is
     named =foo=):
     - =foo_nIterations= :: array with all the values. This is usually
          only usable in the Python-integration
     - =foo_nIterations_first= :: value of the first solver
          performance
     - =foo_nIterations_last= :: value of the first solver performance
**** Function objects for manipulating =fvSchemes= and =fvSolution=
     =simpleFunctionObjects= now has a base class that allows
     manipulating =fvSolution= and =fvSchemes= in-memory but the
     solver behaves as if the file changed on disk. Application for
     this is changing parameters like relaxation or discretization
     schemes during the simulation. This can be used for instance to
     start the simulation with 'safe' settings and switch to faster
     convergence later.

     There is currently only one function object
     =timeDependentFvSolutionFvSchemes= that implements this (more are
     planned). It allows switching to different subdictionaries at
     specified time. An example can be found at
     =Examples/manipulateFvSolutionFvSchemes/pitzDailyTimeSwitched=.
     This function object gets a list of times and
     sub-dictionaries. At the specified time the values from the
     sub-dictionary overrides the values in the original dictionary
     (Values not present in the sub-dictionary are left untouched). If
     =reset= is specified as the name for the sub-dictionary then the
     dictionary is set back to the original state.
*** Enhancements
**** =groovyBC= now has a better initialization if =value= is unset
     Until no if =value= was not set =groovyBC= automatically
     initialized the boundary to $0$ until the actual expressions were
     evaluated for the first time. This raised problems when people
     for instance didn't initialize =T= to $0$ and the density
     calculation produced a /division by zero/.

     Now if =value= is unset then the value of the patch is
     initialized from the value of the internal field next to the
     patch. This doesn't protect from the internal field being
**** Function objects =writeFieldsOften= and =writeAditionalFields= now write Lagrangian clouds
     With an additional optional argument =cloudNames= a list of
     clouds to be written can be specified like the fields.

     This feature was implemented by E. David Huckaby
**** Added option =-functionPlugins= to =funkySetFields= and other utilities
     For utilities for which this is appropriate this allows loading
     function plugins from the command line (without adding them to
     the =libs=-entry in the =controlDict=). It is assumed that the
     name of the library starts with =libswak= and ends with
     =FunctionPlugin.so=.
**** Optional parameter =functionPlugins= for parsers created with a dictionary
     If a list of words named =functionPlugins= is found then the
     string =libswak= is added in front and =FunctionPlugin.so= is
     added at the end and a library of that name is loaded to add the
     functions provided there
**** Additional signals added to =writeTimesOnSignal=
     Now it is possible to handle =SIGUSR1=, =SIGUSR2= and
     =SIGTERM=. Only needed for testing
**** =pythonIntegration= does nothing if no code is present
     If a code is a string of the length $0$ nothing is done. This is
     especially important as no global namespaces are read (which
     *may* not be created at the time. Especially during initialization)
**** =funkyDoCalc= uses =weight= and =mask=
     If a dictionary specifies the entries =mask= and =weight= then
     these are evaluated and used to mask and weight the data
     specified in =expression=
**** =funkyDoCalc= allows setting bin width and number
     If specified in the sub-dictionary the entries
     =distributionMaxBinNr= and =distributionBinWidth= allow setting
     the number of bins. These values are not used exactly but give
     the distribution class a hint. =distributionMaxBinNr= takes
     precedence
**** Timeout in =writeOldTimesOnSignal= to allow other processes to finish writing
     For parallel runs the process that initiates the writing of data
     waits for the other processes to write their data. This time can
     be specified with a parameter =sleepSecondsBeforeReraising= that
     has a default value 60
**** =writeAndEnd=-function objects now allow storing and writing previous time-steps
     The function objects based on =writeAndEnd= now have an optional
     switch =storeAndWritePreviousState=. If this is set then a number
     of old time-steps can be stored and will be written when the run
     is terminated.
**** =fvOption=-subclasses now support additional forms of =addSup=
     In 2.3.1 two new forms of =addSup= where added to =fvOption= (one
     for compressible equations. The other one for multi-phase
     solvers). Both new forms are supported by all
     =fvOption=-subclasses in =swakSourceFields= and =swakFvOptions=
**** =swakExpressionAverageDistribution= allows specifying the limits
     When the switch =dynamicExtremesAbscissa= is =false= then the
     limits of the distribution can be set with =minAbscissa= and
     =maxAbscissa=. This mainly influences the bin-width. If values
     fall outside this range then the distribution is extended to
     accommodate these values
**** Function objects derived from =simpleDataFunctionObject= now can write to a different directory than =postProcessing=
     This involves almost all function objects in swak that write data
     to =postProcessing=. The library now allows setting a different
     default. This value can also be set with an optional entry
     =postProcDir= on a per-function-object basis.

     This change is used in the =funkyPythonPostProc=-utility to set a
     directory name that is based on the name of the input dictionary
     (or set with an option). Now if there are function objects used
     they will write their data to this directory instead of
     =postProcessing= (leaving data generated during the running of
     the solver alone)

     *Note:* This only works for function objects from swak. "Regular"
      function objects will still write to =postProcessing=
**** =funkySetFields= allows correcting the boundary conditions afterwards
     An additional option =-correctResultBoundaryFields= corrects the
     boundary conditions before writing to disk. In dictionary mode
     there is also an option =correctResultBoundaryFields=.

     This is only needed in rare cases.
*** Examples
**** =icoFoamCavityWithParcel= as a minimal example for adding lagrangian particles
     This case demonstrates how to add lagrangian particles to the
     simplest tutorial-case
** 2016-07-17 - version number : 0.4.0
   This is the first release that does not support OpenFOAM 1.7.x,
   OpenFOAM 1.6-ext and older versions anymore
*** New supported versions
**** Rolling support for =OpenFOAM-dev=
     This version adds support for =OpenFOAM-dev= published at
     =git://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-dev.git=

     As this version is constantly changing it might or might not work
     with the most up-to-date version of the repository.

     The port is maintained in a branch =feature/port_of-dev= that is
     never closed and is periodically merged to the =develop=-branch.

     Internally the =dev=-version is maintained as version =9.9.99=
**** Support for OpenFOAM 3.0
     Support for this version has been added (basically all the fixes
     from the =dev=-branch were guarded with the correct version
**** Support for =foam-extend= 4.0
     This version is supported by =swak4Foam= (compiles and runs)
**** Support for the OpenFOAM v3.0+ version
     This version is supported. For the time being it can be assumed
     that this version is similar to the regular OpenFOAM 3.0
*** Bug fixes
**** =fieldReport= doesn't work with all field names
     Fields that have names that are not considered proper variable
     names by swak (because for instance the have a dot in the name
     like =alpha.water=) were not handled by =fieldReport=. This has
     been fixed
**** Construction of =SimpleDistribution= may fail for zero-size fields
     The reason is the initialization with =pTraits::max= and that
     during the calculation of =mag= this causes an overlflow. Fixed
     by scaling down to the square root of the maximum
**** Wrong type for cloud in =writeFieldsGeneral=
     Because of this compilation in 2.2 failed. Fix provided by Bruno Santos
**** =solverPerformanceToGlobalVariables.C= did not compile with OF 2.2
     The reason was that the =solverPerformance=-class is hidden in
     =lduMatrix=. Fix provided by Bruno Santos
**** Solid thermophysics not available in the =ThermoTurb= function plugin
     For OF-versions where =fluidThermo= and =solidThermo= have the
     same base functions like =thermo_Cp= can be used for solids too
**** =lookup=-tables no working in =faField=-parser
     Because of a bug in the lexer lookup tables did not work. Fixed
**** =swakDataEntry= not correctly written for some versions of OpenFOAM
     The macro that guarded the code needed for some OpenFOAM-versions
     did not include OpenFOAM 3.0. Fixed
**** =executeFunctionObjectsFvOption= always executed for =makeRelative= and =makeAbsolute=
     The wrong flags were checked and the function objects were always
     executed when even if =doMakeAbsolute= and =doMakeRelative= were
     set to =false=. Fixed
**** Does not compile with ~WM_LABEL_SIZE=64~
     A reference to a =label= that was passed to a =flex=-function
     broke compilation because that expects a 32-bit integer. Fixed
**** Tensor-fields not correctly handled by =replayTransientBC=
     Due to a copy/past-problem all tensor-fields (including
     symmtrical and spherical) would have caused the utility to
     fail. Fixed
**** Surfaces created by =createSampledSurface= not updated during mesh movement
     The function object ignored the callbacks for moving meshes. It
     now implements them and forces a regeneration of the surface if
     the mesh moves
**** =funkySetFields= does not set dimensions
     The =dimension=-entries were read but not set. This is now fixed
**** =funkySetBoundaryField= does not compress files
     The utility now reads the compression state of the original and
     sets the resulting file accordingly
**** =swakExpression= not working for point fields
     Point fields were not correctly returned. This is fixed
*** Infrastructure
*** Documentation
**** Adaption of the reference guide for new =org-mode=
     New version of =org-mode= makes changes in the UML-code necessary
*** New features
**** 2D-lookup tables supported in grammars
     Like the optional list =lookuptables= it is now possible to have
     a list =lookuptables2D= with 2-dimensional lookup tables. A table
     with the name =tbl= can be used like this in expressions:
     =tbl(expr1,expr2)=. =expr1= and =expr2= must evaluate to scalar
     values of the same entity (cells, faces, points ...) and the
     expression will evaluate to a scalar.

     This feature is based on the =interpolation2DTable= that is part
     of OpenFOAM since 2.2 but there is a modified version of this
     class included in =swak4Foam= as there is a problem with the
     output in the original version. Currently =foam-extend= is not
     supported as this is missing some base classes as well
     (=tableReader=)
**** Added a function plugin for dynamic meshes
     The Plugin =DynamicMesh= adds functions to visualize the mesh
     movement. The functions are
     - dyM_meshPhi :: the mesh =phi= as stored with the mesh. Some
          distributions write this field anyway
     - dyM_meshCourant :: Mesh courant number. Replicates the number
          some solvers print automatically
     - dyM_meshVelocity :: Velocity with which the cells are
          moved. Reconstructed from the mesh =phi=
     These functions might failed if the mesh has not been moved yet
     so their calls might have to be encapsulated in a
     =executeIfStartTime= function Object
**** Function object to load =cell=, =face= and =pointSet=
     The function object =loadTopoSets= loads all the available sets
     in the mesh into memory for expressions that need them. Also
     allows automatic writing of these sets (switched by =writeSets=)
**** Function object to create and manipulate =cell=, =face= and =pointSets=
     The function objects =manipulateCellSet=, =manipulateFaceSet= and
     =manipulatePointSet= allow the manipulation of these
     =topoSet=. They do so by evaluating an expression =mask= and all
     cells (faces, points) for which the expression is =true= will be
     part of the topoSet. If the topoSet is not present in memory the
     function object fails unless the parameter =createMissing= is set
     to =true=. The entry =writeManipulated= (default: =true=) says
     whether the topoSet should be written at write times.

     An example of this functionality is found in =Examples/other/topoSetDamBreak=
**** Function object that executes other function objects only at write time
     The function object =executeIfWriteTime= in the
     =simpleFunctionObjects= executes a list of other function objects
     only if the current time is a scheduled write time. The purpose
     of this function object is to only execute function objects at
     write times that don't honor the
     =outputControlMode=-setting. Also does the =else=-branch allow
     executing only when *nothing* is written
**** Added a function plugin for MRF cases
     This function plugin makes a number of function from the
     =MRF=-model available:
     - functions to make fields absolute or relative in the =MRF= region
     - a function to calculate the Coriolis force
     All these functions call the MRF-model
**** Added library =simpleCloudFunctionObjects= with function objects for particle clouds
     These function objects can be added to particle clouds. In this
     first version these objects can be added:
     - cloudMoveStatistics :: Records simple statistics about the
          solution of the cloud:
       - How often were faces hit by particles (total, per particle:
         minimum, mean and average)
       - How often were particles moved (same data as face hits)
       - How often was each patch hit
       Only minimum effort has been spent to consolidate this data
       across processors (particles may be counted on multiple
       processors).

       The main purpose of this function object is to spot problematic
       behavior (particles that hit patches repeatedly and don't
       move)

       The optional parameter =reportHitNr= and =reportMoveNr= print
       out the ids of particles that exceed these thresholds

     - eliminateCaughtParticles :: Sometimes particles get caught in
          "endless loops" (hitting the same patch over and over again
          without significant movement). This may slow down
          simulations significantly as basically the same impact is
          calculated over and over again without any progress. Two
          parameters allow eliminating such parcels:
       - maximumNumberOfHits :: if the same boundary face is hit more often
         than this by the particle (without hitting any other
         faces) then the particle is eliminated. Recommended value: 1000
       - minDistanceMove :: Minimum distance a particle has to move
         when hitting a boundary face. If it moved less the
         particle is removed. Recommended: $10^{-9}$
       If one of the parameters is set to a negative value the
       criterion is "switched off"
     - eliminateOutsideParticles :: Removes particles that are outside
       the mesh (are not inside any cell). The purpose of this is
       to eliminate particles that are for some reason not
       correctly tracked
     - correctParticleCell :: Correct the cell of the particle before
       the evolution begins.

       This should fix problems with moving meshes but is currently
       not working correctly.

       An optional parameter =logCorrected= logs the data of the
       corrected particles to a file. Only use for debugging or if you don't
       expect many incidents
     - traceParticles :: This function object gets a list of particle
       ids. For these particles all data is written whenever a
       function object is called.

       This function object should *only* be used for debugging if the
       behavior of a special particle should be tracked
**** Add library =swakCloudFunctionObjects= with function objects that use expressions for clouds
     These function objects can be added to particle clouds and use
     expressions. The function objects are
     - eliminateBySwakExpression :: Evaluates an expression for each
       particle. If the expression is =true= then the particle is
       eliminated. Expression can be evaluated before or after the
       moving of the particles
**** =streamFunction= added to =VelocityField= function-plugin
     A function that calculates the stream function in a 2D simulation has been added
*** Enhancements
**** Added function for =smooth=, =sweep=, =spread= to =FvcSchemes=-function plugin
     These functions from =fvc= were implemented as
     plugin-functions. Mainly to be able to test their behavior. To
     check what they do see =fvcSmooth.H= in =finiteVolume=
**** Additional functions in plugin =ThermoTurb=
     Functions from the public interface of =basicThermo= and
     =turbulenceModel= have been added (like =kappa=, =kappaEff= etc)
**** Conditional function objects now allow construction of their =functions= at start
     With the parameter
: constructUnconditionally yes;
     in function objects that start with =executeIf= it is possible to
     construct the lists unconditionally at start instead of waiting
     for the condition to be true. If unset then the function objects
     default to the old behaviour
**** =manipulateField=-function object can switch *off* manipulating at start
     The regular behavior for this function object is that it does
     the first manipulation during construction. This can be switched
     off with the setting =manipulateAtStartup= in cases where not all
     the requirements for correctly evaluating the expressions are
     fulfilled during construction
**** =replayTransientBC= now handles surface and point fields
     The utility can now read surface and point fields. Surface-fields
     are not corrected because this is not supported by Foam
**** =replayTransientBC= reads =fvOptions=
     The utility now reads =fvOptions= for FOAM-versions that support
     it. They have to be switched on with 'useFvOptions' as most of
     the tine they are not needed (only with function objects that
     solve equations)
**** PDE-function objects now have additional =solveAt=-option =never=
     When this option is set then the function-objects are read
     (including the field) but never solved
**** =replayTransientBC= reports execution time
     The utility now reports the time. This is useful when using the
     utility to test function objects
**** Added parameter =sourceImplicitUseSuSp= to =PDE=-function objects
     The function objects =solveLaplacianPDE= and =solveTransportPDE=
     now have a new parameter =sourceImplicitUseSuSp= that allows
     switching from using =Sp()= (the default) to =SuSp()= for the
     addition of =sourceImplicitExpression=
**** =replayTransientBC= can read and update dynamic meshes
     The command line option =-useDynamicMesh= tells the utility to
     read the mesh as a dynamic mesh and update it at every time-step
**** =solveTransportPDE= function object now aware of mesh movement
     If the function object detects that it is created with a moving
     mesh then it asks for a parameter =makePhiRelative= to specify
     whether =phi= should be made relative to the mesh movement (this
     is usually necessary). Then either a =velocityExpression= or a
     =velocityName= has to be specified as well and =phi= is corrected
     according to the mesh movement

     If =steady= is =true= then =phi= is *not* made relative
**** =funkySetLagrangianFields= allows creating fields of arbitrary types
     If a cloud is created and in en entry in =expressions= the entry
     =class= is found then it is assumed that a field of that type
     should be created. The =expression= is not evaluated but added to
     the cloud for each particle.

     *Note:* this does not do *any* semantic checking and is only to
     be used to set constant values for required fields for which
     =swak= can not evaluate the type
**** Unconverged steady solution of PDE-function objects are reset
     For some reason the linear solver does not converge on the
     =solveTransportPDE= and =solveLaplacianPDE= function
     objects. This messes up the solution field. In these cases the
     solution field is reset to the last known good solution. If this
     behavior is undesired it can be switched off with
     =restoreNonConvergedSteady=
**** Additional output options for function obkjects based on =simpleFunctionObjects=
     There are now three more options for =outputControlMode=:
     =outputTimeAndStartup=, =timeStepAndStartup= and
     =deltaTAndStartup=. These work like the other options but write
     data at the startup-time as well
**** =dumpSwakExpression= now works in parallel as well
     This function object used to only dump values from the master
     processor if used in parallel. Now the values from all processors
     are dumped in the order of the processors
**** Missing properties =age= and =dTarget= added to KinematicCloud parser
     Two properties that were missing for that cloud type are now
     available in the parser
*** Examples
**** =solverPDE/pitzDailyWithPDE= extended
     This case has been modified to a version that was presented at
     the PFAU (Austrian User Group Meeting) in 2015. Now it compares
     with the =scalarTransport= function object that was added to
     OpenFOAM.

     The case now also calculates the time the fluid needs from the
     inlet to the outlet (=residenceTime=). Steady as well as
     transient
** 2017-05-31 - version number : 0.4.1
*** New supported versions
**** Support for OpenFOAM v1606+
     This version is supported in the this version of
     =swak4Foam=. There is only one problem: there were changes to the
     =tmp=-template. These changes have been taken care of in the
     =swak4Foam=-sources. *But* there are two source files in the
     distro that need to be modified (basically adding =.ref()=
     instead of =()= in three places:
: src/finiteVolume/finiteVolume/fvc/fvcD2dt2.C
: src/finiteVolume/fvMatrices/fvMatrix/fvMatrixSolve.C
     Therefor the officially released version will *never* compile
     with =swak4Foam= but this is nothing that can be fixed in
     =swak4Foam= (the patch is found in the directory
     =distroPatches/OpenFOAM-v1606+=)
**** Support for OpenFOAM 4.0
     This version is supported in this version of =swak4Foam=. There is
     one problem: the released version has two problems that mean that
     =swak4foam= will *never* compile on the released version.

     Patches fixing these issues are found in the directory
     =distroPatches/OpenFOAM-4.0=
**** Support for OpenFOAM 4.1
     This version is supported in this version of =swak4Foam=. No
     modifications are required
**** Support for OpenFOAM v1612+
     This version supports OpenFOAM v1612+. The modifications were
     done by Mark Olesen
*** Incompatibilities
**** Changed location of files by =simpleFunctionObject= and subclasses for multi-region-cases
     The location of files written by these function objects (which
     are almost all function objects writing data in the
     =postProcessing=-directory) has changed: now if the function
     object belongs to a region that is not the default mesh the
     output is written to a sub-directory with the name of that mesh.

     This might break scripts or other tools that people use to
     process that data
*** Bug fixes
**** Destruction of =dummyPhi= causes error message
     On some distros the destruction of a field stored in an =autoPtr=
     *after* the destruction of the mesh causes an error message. This
     has no effect but is annoying. Fixed
**** =functionObjectListProxy= does not honor =outputTime=
     The function object was executed every time not matter what
     =outputControlMode= was set. Fixed
**** Plugin functions with =bool= results not supported by all drivers
     Until now only the =internalField= and the =faInternalField=
     supported boolean results. Now all drivers support them
**** No plugin function for =cloud= possible
     Because the static variable/method =driverName= was not specified
     no plugin functions for clouds could get specified
**** Wrong syntax in primitive types of plugin-function causes C++-error
     If a primitive function for instance expects a label and finds an
     unscanable string like ~x23~ then this used to generate a failure
     by the C++-library. This gave no indication on the real
     problem. Now there is a OpenFOAM-error message with a somewhat
     better explanation
**** Initialization function objects in =simpleFunctionObjects= fail in parallel
     Because of the wrong order of initialization of these function
     objects they failed in parallel. Fixed
**** Writing =storedVariables= fails for single values in parallel
     This war reported by Philippose Rajan (who also provided a patch) at
     https://sourceforge.net/p/openfoam-extend/ticketsswak4foam/237/

     In parallel if the values was marked as a single value but no
     part of the underlying entity was on the processor it was tried
     to access the first element of an empty field. The fix was to
     write the value $0$ instead. This fix has been adapted so that
     the actual uniform value is written to the file (and read as well)
**** =executeIfOpenFOAMVersionBiggerEqual= not correctly working with alphabetic patch versions
     If the patch version of the current OpenFOAM-version is not a
     number and not =x= then this function object failed
**** =mqFaceMaximum= and =mqFaceMinimum= in the =LocalCalculations=-plugin fail for patch types without values
     As patch types like =empty= have no values stored this plugin
     failed. Now it checks if there is data
**** =simpleFunctionObject= did not pass parent directory correctly
     When storing the data for the function object no reference to the
     parent directory was stored and therefor scoped macro-expansion
     did not work anymore
**** =ThermoTurb= functionPlugin not working with new =thermoType=-format
     The thermophysical functions in this plugin did not work if
     =thermoType= was a dictionary. Fixed

     Also: construction of turbulence now gets the rho-field directly
     from the thermophysics
**** =solidThermo= instances could not use =basicThermo=-methods in =ThermoTurb=-plugin
     Reason was that only two specific thermo-subtypes of
     =fluidThermo= were searched if the method was not part of
     =solidThermo=. Now also the basic type is searched
**** Global variables recognized but not correctly used by some drivers
     The drivers for sampled entities, sets and zones found global
     variables but were not able to use them correctly. Fixed
**** Cloud function-objects that need a parser not working
     The reason is that when constructing the =CloudProxy= a cast is
     made to the /assumed/ cloud type which in the case of cloud
     function-objects is not the /actual/ type. To avoid this separate
     instantiations of the =CloudProxy= were added
*** Internals (for developers)
**** =ExpressionResult= now stores single values separately
     To fix a problem with writing of single values in parallel (see
     above) a =union= was added to store the single values. The reason
     for this is to avoid a second parallel communication when writing
     the value. This adds memory to =ExpressionResult= (in the order
     of a =tenor= object). The memory is not the problem but that the
     single value is saved twice (the other time is in the regular
     value field)

     For compilers that do not support the C++0x-standard instead of a
     =union= a =struct= will be used because non-primitive members for
     =unions= are only supported for that standard. This will lead to
     a slightly higher memory usage (but still small compared to full
     fields)
**** Rewrite of =functionObject= removes the =start()=-method
     OpenFOAM-versions based on the foundation release 4.0 and later
     don't have a =start()=-method in the function objects
     anymore. Lot of functionality of swak relied on this method. To
     make swak compatible across versions =start()= is now called in
     the constructors of the function-objects (if the OpenFOAM-version
     requires it)
*** Infrastructure
**** Add the development branch to the version string in utilities
     If the compiled version is not a released one then the info of
     =hg branch= is added to the version output that utilities like
     =funkySetFields= print
*** Documentation
**** Added /Compatibility matrix/ for examples
     Different OpenFOAM-versions have different formats for the input
     files. This means that examples that work for one version will
     break with another version (but is still useful to see how things
     are done). The file
     =Documentation/examplesCompatibilityMatrix.org= gives an
     (incomplete) overview on which versions run which examples (some
     examples will never run because a certain feature might be
     missing in that Foam-version)

     Currently 4 Foam-versions are tested
     - OpenFOAM 4.1 (the Foundation release)
     - Foam-extend 4.0
     - OpenFOAM+ 1612
     - OpenFOAM 2.3 (to check compatibility with old versions)
     Other versions might or might not work. The first three will be
     replaced with the latest version of that fork once it becomes
     available
*** New features
**** Function plugin =ShiftField= that allows shifting volume fields
     When adding the library =libswakShiftFieldFunctionPlugin.so= to
     =libs= in the =controlDict= functions are added that allow
     shifting volume fields by a specified distance. One example
     would be an expression
: "shiftConstantScalarField(T,(1 1 0))"
     which generates a new =volScalarField= where the value at =(0 0
     0)= is the value of =T= at the location =(1 0 0)=.

     The scheme for naming the functions is
     =scalar<ShiftType><ValueType>Field= with
     - ValueType :: one of the base types =Scalar=, =Vector=,
          =Tensor=, =SymmTensor=, =SphericalTensor=
     - ShiftType :: how the shift is specified. Possible values are either
       - Constant :: A constant vector (like the example here)
       - Expression :: An expression that gives a =pointVectorField=
            (for instance =interpolateToPoint(time()*vector(0,0,-1))=)

     These functions work by generating a new mesh that is shifted as
     specified (in the inverse direction) and interpolating between
     this and the original mesh. This is computationally *very*
     expensive and therefor not recommended in evaluations that occur
     very often.

     Cells that have no shifted equivalent value are set to
     zero. Boundary patches are not interpolated. Both of these
     behaviors can cause weird results.

     There are also variants with =Default= in the end. These allow
     setting different default values than $0$

     The functions with the names =map<ShiftType><ValueType>Field= map
     the value of the nearest cell. This is more stable but might
     coarsen the field

     The additional =findShifted<ValueType>Field=-functions do the
     mapping by avoiding the =meshToMesh=-functions of OpenFOAM: the
     shifted value is found by "looking" into the original cell that
     contains the point that is the cell center plus the displacement
     value. If that point is not in the mesh a default value is used
**** Library =swakStateMachine= to easily implement switching in cases
     This library implements /State machines/. This is a convenient
     way to store a state in a simulation and switch between them by
     predefined rules. An example for states in a /State machine/
     would be: =closed=, =valveOpening=, =open=, =valveClosing=

     The library has the function objects and plugin functions to use
     /State machines/.

     The chapter /State machines/ in the /Incomplete swak4Foam
     reference/ describes it in more detail
**** Function object =stateMachineFvSolutionFvSchemes= to switch numerics accorrding to a state machine
     This function object allows modifying =fvSchemes= and
     =fvSolution= according to the states of two state machines.
**** Function plugin =Quantile= for calculations with the distribution of a function
     All the functions in this plugin first calculate a
     distribution. This distribution is calculated from the first parameters:
     1. the field for which the distribution is calculated
     2. the weight with which the cell values enter the
        distribution. Usually =vol()= (volume weighted) or =1= (equal
        weight for all cells)
     3. a logical expression that specifies which cells are used
        (=true= for all cells)
     4. the number of bins to use for the distribution. This specifies
        how fine the distribution is calculated. Should be small
        compared to the number of cells. Usually the values =100= or
        =1000= should be sufficient
     The implemented functions are
     - fracSmallerThan :: Writes a fraction in the range from $0$ to
          $1$ with for instance $0.5$ meaning "50 % of the
          distribution is smaller than the value in this cell". The
          cells which are masked out get the value $-1$.
     - fracSmallerThanFromOther :: Like =fracSmallerThan= but there is
          an additional parameter: the field that is used for
          calculating the fraction. Here the mask is not used for
          calculating the fraction (but still used for calculating the
          distribution)
     - quantileFromOther :: Basically the inverse of
          =fracSmallerThanFromOther=. The last parameter is a fraction
          (from $0$ to $1$) and the result is the corresponding
          quantile: if a fraction $0.5$ is specified then the value
          from the distribution for which 50% are smaller is written
          to the cell
     Note: values may slightly vary according to the number of
     bins. But the bin number also increases the calculation time.
**** Function =outputTime()= to indicate output time
     A function =outputTime()= has been added to the parsers. This
     function is =true= if Foam is writing at the current time and
     =false= else
**** Utility =writeBoundarySubfields= to write subfields of boundary conditions
     Sometimes to debug problems with boundary conditions it is good
     to *look* at fields like =refValue= in Paraview (for instance
     because =groovyBC= might not have set that value the way we
     expected it). For a field =foo= the utility would write a field
     =foo_bar= if the user specified =bar= to be written. The interior
     of the field will be $0$, patches where =bar= is defined will be
     =fixedValue= with the value of =bar=. All others are
     =zeroGradient=

     A string with the specificion of the subfields to create fields
     for is set with the option =-subfields=. The specifications are
     separated by =,=. Each specification is of the form
     =<name>:<type>= (with type being =scalar=, =vector=, =symmTensor=
     or =sphericalTensor=. A type =native= assumes that the same type
     as the field should be used). If unset the default value is used:
     the specification to write all subfields usually associated with
     the =mixed= boundary condition

     It is assumed that the length of the sub-field is equal to the
     number of faces in the patch
**** Library =swakDynamicMesh= with "swakified" dynamic mesh subclasses
     This libraries collects specializations of dynamic mesh classes
     that work together with OpenFOAM. Currently these classes are in
     the library:
     - swakMotion :: this is a solid body motion solver for the
          =solidBodyMotionFvMesh= where the translation and the
          rotation of the solid body can be specified by =swak=-expressions
     - groovyCyclicACMI :: this patch type is a subclass of
          =cyclicACMI= where the faces that cyclic can be switched on
          and off with an additional field that is specified with the
          parameter =openField= in the specification in the
          =boundary=-file. This field has to be present in memory at
          the first time-step (usually a
          =readAndUpdateFields=-functionObject is a good way to
          achieve this). The values on the corresponding
          =nonOverlapPatch= of the first boundary in the coupled pair
          is used to switch faces on and off: if the value of the face
          is $1$ then it is 'open' if it is $0$ it is 'closed'
     - nonMovingFvMesh :: A non-moving mesh that pretends to
          move. This triggers the recalculation of AMI-interfaces
     - groovyBCJumpAMI :: allows implementing a jump condition on an
          AMI-interface that depends on an expression evaluated on the
          master patch of the interface
     The folder =Examples/DynamicMesh= has examples for this library
**** Record current residual of the equations with =fvOptions=
     The two =fvOptions= =matrixChangeBefore= and =matrixChangeAfter=
     can be used to record the residual or the change of it.

     The residual $r$ for a field $\phi$ which is supposed to be the
     solution of a linear equation $A \phi = b$ is $r=A \phi-b$

     =matrixChangeBefore= calculates this for a $\phi$ specified in
     =fieldName= and uses for $A$ and $b$ the current =fvMatrix= of
     that field. The result is stored in a field whose name is
     composed of the value of =namePrefix= and =fieldName=. This field
     can be useful to see where the current solution does not fit the
     linearized system

     =matrixChangeAfter= does the same calculation but assumes that
     the field already exists and subtracts the result from the
     previous value. So if another =fvOption= was applied to the
     =fvMatrix= between these calls then the field has the change of
     this matrix. If "only" a source term was added then this field
     corresponds to the source term.

     In principle =fvOptions= are executed in the order in which they
     are specified. If the setting =doAtAddSup= is set to =true= then
     it is executed in an early phase (when source terms are set). If
     set to =false= then the =fvOption= is executed during the
     =setValues=/=constrain= phase.
**** Setting time-step with an expression: =setDeltaTBySwakExpression=
     This new function object in =simpleSwakFunctionObjects= evaluates
     a =scalar= expression and sets =deltaT= accordingly. Only works
     on OpenFOAM-versions that support =DataEntry= or its successor
     =Function1Types=.
*** Enhancements
**** Primitive parser for Plugin-functions now supports tensor types
     The parser for =primitve= types now supports =tensor=,
     =symmTensor= and =sphericalTensor= as well.
**** Plugin-functions now can use =variables= (under certain circumstances)
     For an expression =fooFunmction(var+2)= where =fooFunction= is a
     Plugin-function the symbol =var= can now be a variable: if in the
     parent dictionary there is a sub-dictionary =fooFunctionData=
     then this dictionary is searched for a =variables=-entry and
     these variables are then evaluated (it is also possible to have
     =lookuptables= and similar in =fooFunctionData=)
**** Timeline function objects now optionally write value at start time
     Function objects that inherit from =timelineFunctionObject= (like
     =swakExpression=) now have an optional parameter
     =writeStartTime=. If set to =yes= then the value at start-time
     will be written. The default setting is =no=. This is similar to
     the old behavior and avoids crashes at startup. Some classes
     change this default to make it =yes=
**** Additional functions in the radiation function plugin
     Additional functions for the =absorptionEmissionModel= and the
     =sootModel= are added to to library with the radiation-functions
**** Improvement of =readAndUpdateFields=: surface fields, output, switching
     The function object =readAndUpdateFields= got three improvements:
     - an optional switch =correctBoundary= allows switching the
       correction of boundary conditions off
     - surface-fields are now read as well. But no boundary correction
       is performed as the these fields do not support this
     - better output. Instead of silently reading fields or using
       those in memory the name of the field and the type are written
       out
**** =executeIfStartTime= now also allows execution if it is "only" a restart
     Normally the function object only executes only if this is the
     real start time (not a restart). If the option =executeOnRestart=
     is set then the function object also executes if this is a restart
**** =reportAvailableFvOptions= now reports =constrain=-methods
     On OpenFOAM-versions that support it this now reports if
     =constrain= is called for an equation
**** =constrain= method added to =fvOptions=
     In earlier OpenFOAM-versions the name of this method was
     =setValue=. To keep source compatibility this method is kept and
     the method =constrain= patches through to it. If the =fvOption=
     has =SetValue= in the name then this name is kept
**** =simpleFunctionObjects= in multi-region cases now write to sub-directories of =postProcessing=
     To conform with the way that regular OpenFOAM function objects do
     it now function objects that belong to the non-default mesh in
     multi-region cases write their data to a sub-directory of
     =postProcessing= named after the mesh
**** =funkyWarpMesh= allows reading function objects
     Function objects can now be loaded with an option
     =-allowFunctionObjects=
**** =executeIfStartTime= now also allows execution if it is "only" a restart
     Normally the function object only executes only if this is the
     real start time (not a restart). If the option =executeOnRestart=
     is set then the function object also executes if this is a restart
**** Scoped macro expansion now works for =storedVariables= and =swakDataEntry=
     When reading these data structures the parent directory is
     correctly passed and therefor scoped macro expansions
     (=$[:deltaT]= for instance) works
*** Examples
**** =FvOptions/heatExchangerSources=
     Demonstrates getting changes to the solution (residuals) with
     =matrixChangeBefore= and =matrixChangeAfter=

     - Examples/StateMachine/stateCavity :: demonstrates the basic
          functionality of state machines
     - Examples/manipulateFvSolutionFvSchemes/pitzDailyStateMachineSwitched :: demonstrates
          using state machines to manipulate the discretization during
          a simulation
**** Dynamic mesh examples
     The folder =Examples/DynamicMesh= has examples that demonstrate
     capabilities of the =swakDynamicMesh=-library.
     - rotatingTank2D :: is a demonstration of a =solidBody= mesh
                         movement where translation and rotation are
                         described by swak-expressions

          a =ACMI= boundary condition where switching of faces is done
          by a swak-expression. Won't work with =Foam-extend= as this
          has no =ACMI=
