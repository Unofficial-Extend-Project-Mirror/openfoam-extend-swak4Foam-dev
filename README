* Description
  A collection of libraries and tools that let the user handle
  OpenFOAM-data based on expressions

* Installation/Compilation
** Requirements
   - Version 1.7 or 1.6-ext of OpenFOAM (1.6 should work, too)
     - The =finiteArea=-stuff will only work with version 1.6-ext
   - the compiler generators =bison= and =flex=
   - =simpleSwakFunctionObjects= needs the =simpleFunctionObjects=
     (see
     http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_simpleFunctionObjects)
     all other functionality has no additional requirements
     (=simpleSwakFunctionObjects= is only required by some examples)
     It is assumed that the sources are installed at
     =$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/Libraries/simpleFunctionObjects= 

     A script =downloadSimpleFunctionObjects.sh= is provided that
     automatically downloads the =simpleFunctionObjects= into the
     Libraries-directory and compiles it. *Warning:* Don't mix this
     with an installation at =$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/Libraries/= unless
     you know what you're doing
** Building
  =wmake all= at the base directory should build all the libraries and
  tools.

  The main library =swak4FoamParsers= can't be built in parallel (no
  values of =WM_NCOMPPROCS= bigger than 1)
** Global installation
   If the libraries and utilities are considered stable and the should
   be available to everyone (without having to recompile them) the
   script =copySwakFilesToGlobal.sh= can be used to copy them to the
   global directories.

   The script =removeSwakFilesFromGlobal.sh= removes all these files
   from the global directories
** Packaging
*** Debian
    The command =build dpkg= builds a Debian/Ubuntu package for 
    the *currently enabled* OpenFOAM-package. Note:
    - it is assumed that the currently used OF-version was also
      installed by the package manager
    - the =dev= package is built but poorly maintained
    - =simpleFunctionOjects= are automatically included in the
      package. To avoid this remove the =simpleFunctionObjects= from
      the =Libraries= directory and do =make dpkg-only=
    Changes in the packaging should be done in the branch
      =debianPackaging= of the Mercurial-repository
* Contents
** Libraries
   Collection of Libraries
*** =swak4FoamParsers=
    The basis of =swak4Foam=: the expression parsers with the logic to
    access the /OpenFOAM/ data-structures.

    None of the other software pieces compile without it
*** =groovyBC=
    Implements the infamous =groovyBC=. A boundary condition that
    allows arbitrary expressions in the field-file
*** =swakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects that have no additional requirements. Mainly used
    for manipulating and creating fields with expressions
*** =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects based on the =simpleFunctionObjects=-library
    (which is a prerequisite for compiling it).

    Evaluate expressions and output the results
*** =swakSourceFields=
    Field that is calculated from an expression. To be used as
    source-term or coefficient in some solver
*** =swakTopoSources=
    =topoSources= for =cellSet= and =faceSet=. Can be used with the
    =cellSet= and =faceSet=-utilities 
*** =swakFiniteArea=
    Implements parsers for the =finiteArea=-stuff in 1.6-ext. Also
    implements =groovyBC= for =areaField= and =expressionField=
*** =groovyStandardBCs=
    Collection of boundary conditions that give standard boundary
    conditions the possibility to use expression for the coefficients

    Contributions to this library are explicitly encouraged. Please
    use the Mercurial-branch =groovyStandardBCs= to /groovyify/
    standard boundary conditions.
** Utilities
*** =funkySetFields=
    Utility that allows creation and manipulation of files with
    expressions 
*** =funkySetAreaFields=
    Utility like =funkySetFields= for =areaFields= (only works with
    1.6-ext) 
*** =funkySetBoundaryField=
    Sets any field on a boundary to a non-uniform value based on an
    expression. 

    Acts without deeper understanding of the underlying boundary condition
*** =replayTransientBC=
    Utility to quickly test whether a groovyBC gives the expected
    results. Writes the specified fields with the applied boundary
    condition but doesn't do anything else.

    Can be used for other BCs as well
** Examples
   If not otherwise noted cases are prepared by a simple
   =blockMesh=-call.

   *All the cases here are strictly for demonstration purposes and
    resemble nothing from the 'real world'*
*** groovyBC

* Known bugs
** Moving meshes and =sampledSurfaces= 
   It seems that with moving meshes =sampledSurfaces= don't get
   updated. This seems to be a problem with OpenFOAM itself (the
   regular =surfaces=-functionObject doesn't get updated. This is
   currently investigated
** Missing support for interpolation and point-Fields
   Apart from patches and internal fields the support for
   interpolation from cells to faces (and vice versa) is incomplete as
   well as point fields (although they are supported in the grammar)
* History
** 2010-09-13
   First Release
** 2010-12-18
   New release
   Most important changes
*** Parser for =sampledSurfaces=
    Now expressions for the field on a sampled surface can be
    evaluated. All =sampledSurfaces= offered by OpenFOAM now can be
    used 
*** Multiline =variables=
    The =variables= entry (most notably used in =groovyBC= and
    =swakExpression=) now can be a list of strings. This allows some
    kind of "formatting" (one expression per line) and should improve
    readability
*** Two maintainance-scripts were added 
    These can copy the libraries and utilities to the global
    installation (for those who think that the swak4Foam-stuff is
    stable enough and want to 'bless' all users at their site with
    it). Note that any local installation still takes precedence
    (because =$FOAM_USER_APPBIN= is before =$FOAM_APPBIN= in the
    =$PATH= 
*** Parsers using 'external variables' are now run-time selectable
    This allows the inclusion of other parsers with the regular
    =swak4Foam= parsers and include them seamlessly with the
    =variables=-mechanism for 'externals' (in other words: you can add
    your own parser in a separate library without having to change
    anything about the overall =swak4Foam=, but it behaves as if it
    was part of it)
** 2011-01-30
*** Support for /Finite Area/-stuff
    Now there is support for the =finiteArea=-library found in
    1.6-dev. The support is found in a separate library
    =swakFiniteArea=. It has
    - a parser =faField= for =areaFields=
    - a parser =faPatch= for patches of =areaFields=
    - a variant of =groovyBC= for these patches
    - a computed source =faExpressionSource=
    - Function-object-variants for =areaFields=: =clearExpression=,
      =expressionField= and =manipulateField=. These work the same as
      their =volField=-counterparts
