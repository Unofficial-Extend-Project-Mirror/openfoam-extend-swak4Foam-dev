** Documentation
   See: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/contrib/swak4Foam
* Installation/Compilation
** Requirements
   - Version 2.0 of OpenFOAM (a version that works with 1.6, 1.6-ext
     and 1.7 is available separately)
     - The =finiteArea=-stuff will probably work with version 2.0-ext
       (once that is available)
   - the compiler generators =bison= and =flex=
** Building
  =wmake all= at the base directory should build all the libraries and
  tools.

  The main library =swak4FoamParsers= can't be built in parallel (no
  values of =WM_NCOMPPROCS= bigger than 1)
** Global installation
   If the libraries and utilities are considered stable and the should
   be available to everyone (without having to recompile them) the
   script =copySwakFilesToSite.sh= can be used to copy them to the
   global site-specific directories.

   The script =removeSwakFilesFromSite.sh= removes all these files
   from the global directories. The =removeSwakFilesFromLocal.sh= does
   the same for the user directories (this makes sure that no
   self-compiled version /shadows/ the global version (which would
   lead to strange results)

   There is a =Makefile= attached. =make install= compiles =swak4Foam=
   and installs it into the global directories

   *Note:* Due to the order in which library direcories are searched
   for with =-L= a global installation might break the compilation
** Packaging
*** Debian
    The command =build dpkg= builds a Debian/Ubuntu package for 
    the *currently enabled* OpenFOAM-package. Note:
    - it is assumed that the currently used OF-version was also
      installed by the package manager
    - the =dev= package is built but poorly maintained
    Changes in the packaging should be done in the branch
      =debianPackaging= of the Mercurial-repository

    *Note:* Due to the problem described with the global installation
    it might be necessary to deinstall a previously installed package
    to successfully build a new package
* Contents
** Libraries
   Collection of Libraries
*** =swak4FoamParsers=
    The basis of =swak4Foam=: the expression parsers with the logic to
    access the /OpenFOAM/ data-structures.

    None of the other software pieces compile without it
*** =simpleFunctionObjects=
    A collection of function objects that was previously separately
    available at
    http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_simpleFunctionObjects.

    Provides consistent output of values (on patches and fields) and
    more.
*** =groovyBC=
    Implements the infamous =groovyBC=. A boundary condition that
    allows arbitrary expressions in the field-file
*** =swakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects that have no additional requirements. Mainly used
    for manipulating and creating fields with expressions
*** =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects based on the =simpleFunctionObjects=-library
    (which is a prerequisite for compiling it).

    Evaluate expressions and output the results
*** =swakSourceFields=
    These classes allow to manipulate the solution. To use these the
    solver has to be modified.
    - expressionSource :: Field that is calculated from an
         expression. To be used as source-term or coefficient in some
         solver
    - forceEquation :: force an equation to fixed values in selected
                       locations. Has to be used after constructing
                       the equation and before solving
*** =swakTopoSources=
    =topoSources= for =cellSet= and =faceSet=. Can be used with the
    =cellSet= and =faceSet=-utilities 
*** =swakFiniteArea=
    Implements parsers for the =finiteArea=-stuff in 1.6-ext. Also
    implements =groovyBC= for =areaField= and =expressionField= and
    other function objects
*** =groovyStandardBCs=
    Collection of boundary conditions that give standard boundary
    conditions the possibility to use expression for the coefficients

    Contributions to this library are explicitly encouraged. Please
    use the Mercurial-branch =groovyStandardBCs= to /groovyify/
    standard boundary conditions.
** Utilities
*** =funkySetFields=
    Utility that allows creation and manipulation of files with
    expressions 
*** =funkySetAreaFields=
    Utility like =funkySetFields= for =areaFields= (only works with
    1.6-ext) 
*** =funkySetBoundaryField=
    Sets any field on a boundary to a non-uniform value based on an
    expression. 

    Acts without deeper understanding of the underlying boundary condition
*** =replayTransientBC=
    Utility to quickly test whether a groovyBC gives the expected
    results. Writes the specified fields with the applied boundary
    condition but doesn't do anything else.

    Can be used for other BCs as well
*** =funkyDoCalc=
    Evaluates expressions that are listed in a dictionary using data
    that is found on the disc and prints summarized data (min, max,
    average, sum) to the screen
** Examples
   If not otherwise noted cases are prepared by a simple
   =blockMesh=-call.

   *All the cases here are strictly for demonstration purposes and
    resemble nothing from the 'real world'*
*** groovyBC
    The old =groovyBC=-Demos
**** pulsedPitzDaily
    - Solver :: pisoFoam
    - Also demonstrates :: =manipulateField=, =expressionField= and
         =clearField= from the
         =swakFunctionObjects=. =patchExpression= from
         =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=. 
**** wobbler
    - Solver :: solidDisplacementFoam
**** circulatingSplash 
    - Solver :: interDyMFoam 
    - Remark :: this one crashes halfway through the calculation. If
                you can fix it: Be my guest
**** movingConeDistorted
    - Solver :: pimpleDyMFoam
    - Also demonstrates :: =swakExpression= with =surface=. Due to a
      problem described below this currently doesn't work
**** average-t-junction
    - Solver :: pimpleFoam
    - Mesh preparation :: Execute the script =prepare.sh= in that
         directory (requires PyFoam: if not installed change in the
         =boundary=-file the type of the =defaultFaces= to =wall=)
**** multiRegionHeaterFeedback
    - Solver :: chtMultiRegionFoam
    - Mesh preparation :: Execute the script =prepare.sh= in that
         directory 
    - Also demonstrated :: =patchExpression= and =swakExpression= from
         =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=. 
**** fillingTheDam
     - Solver :: interFoam
     - Also demonstrates :: Usage of a =sampledSet= defined in the
          =controlDict= do determine the average filling height. Also
          stored variables for not switching back once the criterion
          is reached
*** FunkySetFields
    Example dictionary for =funkySetFields=
*** FunkySetBoundaryFields
    Example dictionary for =funkySetBoundaryFields=. Sets nonsense
    boundary conditions for the world famous =damBreak=-case
*** InterFoamWithSources
    Demonstrates usage of =expressionSource=

    Due to differences in the original =interFoam=-solver this doesn't
    work on certain OpenFOAM-versions (most specifically
    =1.6-ext=).

    The only modifications to the original solver are found at the end
    of =createFields.H= and in =UEqn.H= (the added source terms).
*** InterFoamWithFixed
    Demonstrates usage of =forceEquation=

    Due to differences in the original =interFoam=-solver this doesn't
    work on certain OpenFOAM-versions (most specifically
    =1.6-ext=).

    The only modifications to the original solver are found at the end
    of =createFields.H= and in =UEqn.H= (the fixing of the velocities).
**** =interFoamWithSources=
     Slightly modified version of =interFoam=. Adds a source term to
     the momentum equation. The source term is an expression that is
     defined at run-time
**** =mixingThing=
     Demonstration case for it.
     - Preparation :: Run the script =prepare.sh= to prepare the case
*** FiniteArea
    Demonstration of the =finiteArea=-stuff that works with 1.6-ext
**** =swakSurfactantFoam=
     Variation of =surfactantFoam= that adds an =expressionSource=
**** =planeTransport=
     Demonstration case
     - Preparation :: Use =blockMesh= and =makeFaMesh=
     - Solver :: =surfactantFoam= (without source term) or
                 =swakSurfactantFoam=
     - Demonstrates :: FAM-specific =swakExpressions= and =groovyBC=
                       (as well as the =expressionSource=)
*** other
    Cases that don't have a =groovyBC=
**** =angledDuctImplicit=
     - Solver :: rhoPorousMRFSimpleFoam
     - Mesh preparation :: Execute the =makeMesh.sh=-script in that
          directory. If you want to run in parallel call the
          =decomposeMesh.sh=-script with the number of processors as
          an argument
     - Demonstrates :: Usage of the =swakTopoSources=. Compares
          different approaches to evaluating with the
          =swakExpression=-functionObject. Also an example dictionary
          that demonstrates the use of =funkyDoCalc=
**** =capillaryRise=
     - Solver :: interFoam
     - Case preparation :: run the supplied script =prepareCase.sh=
     - Demonstrates :: Usage of a sampled surface to track the
                       interface in a VOF-simulation
*** tests
    Simple test cases for specific features
**** =randomCavity=
     Testing of different seeds for the =rand=-function. Also tests
     the =randFixed=-function
* Bug reporting and Development
** Bug reports
   The preferred place for bug reports is
   http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/search.php?project_id=10&sticky_issues=on&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=90 
   
   A sourceforge-account is required for reporting
** Development
   Contributions to to =swak4Foam= are most welcome. If you want to
   contribute clone the Mercurial archive of the sources
: hg clone http://openfoam-extend.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/openfoam-extend/swak4Foam
   Change to the branch that you want to improve (usually =default=)
   and create a new branch
: hg branch <branchName>
   where =<branchname>= is an easily identifiable name that makes the
   purpose of the branch clear (for instance
   =bugfixWrongRandomFunction= or =featureHyperbolicFunctions=). Don't
   work on the =default= branch or any other branches that are not
   "yours". Such contributions will not be merged

   Once development on the branch is finished export the relevant
   changesets with 
: hg export <nodeID>
   (=nodeID= being the ids of "your" changesets) and send them to the
   maintainer (or attach them to a bug report on Manits). The changes
   will be reviewed and merged into the =default= branch (do not
   attempt to do this yourself). Patches generated with =hg export=
   make sure that all changes are attributed to the original developer
   (you).

   Once you have proven by successfully submitting changesets via =hg
   export= you can ask for write access to the mercurial repository.
*** Suggest reading
    These topics may be "new" for the average OF-developer:
    - Mercurial :: A short tutorial on this can be found at
                   http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide/. If you already
                   know =git= the
                   http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/GitConcepts may
                   be enough for you
    - bison/flex :: This pair of compiler generator tools generate the
                    parsers for the expressions. Google for a tutorial
                    that looks promising to you.

		    For a short example that shows how a new function
		    was added to two parsers have a look at this
		    changeset that added the =cpu()=-function to the
		    field and the the patch-parser (usually you'll
		    have to write a new method for the driver too):
: hg diff -c 8604e865cce6
*** Special branches
    Currently the main branches are:
    - default :: The *main* branch. This is the brancht that the
                 general public will receive. It compiles under 1.7
                 and 1.6-ext
    - port_2.0.x :: The branch that compiles under OpenFOAM 2.0. This
                    will eventually become the =default=-branch
    - debianPackaging :: Branch for generating new Debian-packages of
         =swak4Foam=. If somebody wants to "inherit" this: contact the
         maintainer 
    - finiteArea :: In this branch the things for the
                    =finiteArea=-discretization (only present in
                    =1.6-ext=) is developed. Usually gets merged back
                    into the =default=-branch once a feature is completed

* Known bugs
** Moving meshes and =sampledSurfaces= 
   It seems that with moving meshes =sampledSurfaces= don't get
   updated. This seems to be a problem with OpenFOAM itself (the
   regular =surfaces=-functionObject doesn't get updated. This is
   currently investigated
** Missing support for interpolation and point-Fields
   Apart from patches and internal fields the support for
   interpolation from cells to faces (and vice versa) is incomplete as
   well as point fields (although they are supported in the grammar)
** Caching of loaded fields not working
   This is especially evident for the =funkyDoCalc=-example
** Possible enhancements of the code
   Not really bugs, but stuff that bugs me
*** Pointers in the driver code
    This is necessary because of =bison=. Investigate possibilities to
    replace these by =tmp= and =autoPtr= 
** Possible memory loss
   =valgrind= reports some lost memory for stuff that is not directly
   allocated by =swak4Foam= (in OpenFOAM-sources)

   Will investigate. Relevant places are marked by comments in the
   code. Also the construction of =sampledSet= seems to loose memory
* History
** 2010-09-13
   First Release
** 2010-12-18
   New release
   Most important changes
*** Parser for =sampledSurfaces=
    Now expressions for the field on a sampled surface can be
    evaluated. All =sampledSurfaces= offered by OpenFOAM now can be
    used 
*** Multiline =variables=
    The =variables= entry (most notably used in =groovyBC= and
    =swakExpression=) now can be a list of strings. This allows some
    kind of "formatting" (one expression per line) and should improve
    readability
*** Two maintainance-scripts were added 
    These can copy the libraries and utilities to the global
    installation (for those who think that the swak4Foam-stuff is
    stable enough and want to 'bless' all users at their site with
    it). Note that any local installation still takes precedence
    (because =$FOAM_USER_APPBIN= is before =$FOAM_APPBIN= in the
    =$PATH= 
*** Parsers using 'external variables' are now run-time selectable
    This allows the inclusion of other parsers with the regular
    =swak4Foam= parsers and include them seamlessly with the
    =variables=-mechanism for 'externals' (in other words: you can add
    your own parser in a separate library without having to change
    anything about the overall =swak4Foam=, but it behaves as if it
    was part of it)
** 2011-01-30
*** Support for /Finite Area/-stuff
    Now there is support for the =finiteArea=-library found in
    1.6-dev. The support is found in a separate library
    =swakFiniteArea=. It has
    - a parser =faField= for =areaFields=
    - a parser =faPatch= for patches of =areaFields=
    - a variant of =groovyBC= for these patches
    - a computed source =faExpressionSource=
    - Function-object-variants for =areaFields=: =clearExpression=,
      =expressionField= and =manipulateField=. These work the same as
      their =volField=-counterparts
*** Bugfix for compiling in single precision
    See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=49
*** New function =nearDist=
    See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=44
** 2011-04-20
   New features and changes are (this list is not complete):
*** New utility =funkySetAreaField=
    Like =funkySetFields= for /finiteArea/. Also writes out a volume
    field for easier post-processing
*** Refactoring of =groovyBC= and groovified boundary conditions
    Makes it easier to use the =groovyBC=-machinery for other boundary
    conditions. Two standard boundary conditions were
    /groovified/. Others may follow
*** Easier deployment
    If no =simpleFunctionObjects= are present they can be downloaded
    by a script.
    Also scripts to handle global installations of =swak4Foam=
*** Force equations
    A class to force equations to certain values according to
    expressions
*** New utility =funkyDoCalc=
    Utility does calculations on saved results and outputs single
    numbers (min, max, sum, average) to the terminal. Can be used for
    reporting or validity checks
*** Debian packaging
    Crude packaging for Debian
*** Lookup-tables
    A single-argument function can be specified as a piecewise linear
    function. Basically works like timelines but the argument can be
    something else (not only the time)
*** Stored variables
    Variables that store their values between time-steps. Applications
    are statistics or switches
*** Sampled sets
    Sampled sets can now also be used as en entity on which
    calculation is possible.
** 2011-07-26
*** Port to OpenFOAM 2.0
    This is the first release that officially supports OpenFOAM 2.0
    
    Also it is the first release that incorporates the
    =simpleFunctionObjects=-library 
*** New features:
**** Rewrite of =rand= and =randNormal=
     - These two functions now can receive an integer seed that
       determines the pseudo-randooom sequence generated by  these functions
     - Two functions =randFixed= and =randNormalFixed= were
       added. While the usual =rand= functions generate a different
       result at every time-steps for these functions the pseudo-random
       sequence is determined *only* by the seed (not by the timestep)
**** Binary =min= and =max=
     Take the bigger/smaller of two fields. Helps avoid =?:=-operations
**** Allow writing of only volume-fields in =funkySetAreaFields=
     Application: If the results of the calculation are only needed in
     ParaView
**** Internal changes
     - Use =autoPtr= for sets
     - Update sets that change in memory or on disc
*** Bug-fixes
**** =funkySetAreaFields= did not check for the correct fields
     Fixed by Petr Vita
**** =surfaceProxy= uses the wrong geometric data
**** Avoid floating point exceptions with division of fields
     Calculated boundaries were $0$ and caused a division by zero
*** Packaging
**** Update Debian packaging
     - Packaging information for the currently used OF-version is
       generated (allows a separate =swak=-package for every OF-version
     - Submission to launchpad added
**** Deployment scripts
     Now install to =FOAM_SITE_APPBIN/LIBBIN=
