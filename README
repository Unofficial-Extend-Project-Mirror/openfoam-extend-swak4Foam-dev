#+TITLE: =README= for =swak4Foam=
* Description
  A collection of libraries and tools that let the user handle
  OpenFOAM-data based on expressions
* About this document
** Scope
   This file gives an overview of =swak4Foam= and a history of the
   features. It is not a canonical documentation.
** Technical
   This file is written in the mighty =org-mode= (see
   [[http://orgmode.org/]]) a markup/outline-mode for (X)Emacs. Using this
   mode it can be easily (using 3 keystrokes ... it's Emacs) to PDF or
   HTML to make it more readable (and add a table of contents).

   Please don't try to "beautify" it with any other text editor as
   this will surly mess up the markup (and keeping the file
   /org-compatible/ outside of the =org-mode= is a pain in the neck.

   Contributors to =simpleFunctionObjects= are listed separately in
   the =README= of that library
** Documentation
   See: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/contrib/swak4Foam
* Installation/Compilation
** Requirements
   - Version 2.0 or 2.1 of OpenFOAM (a version that works with 1.6,
     1.6-ext and 1.7 is available separately)
     - The =finiteArea=-stuff will probably work with version 2.0-ext
       (once that is available)
   - the compiler generators =bison= and =flex=
     - =swak4Foam= is known to work with =bison= version 2.3 and
       higher. Lower versions *may* work. If it works with a lower
       version please report it
** Building
: wmake all 
   at the base directory should build all the libraries and
   tools.

  The main library =swak4FoamParsers= can't be built in parallel (no
  values of =WM_NCOMPPROCS= bigger than 1)
*** Additional configuration
    Some features (currently only the =Python=-integration may need
    third party software. The paths to these packages can be configured
    in a file =swakConfiguration= (an example file
    =swakConfiguration.example= is provided). If that file is not
    present these unconfigured features will not be compiled.
*** Possible compilation failure with old 2.0.x-versions
    With older versions of 2.0.x (or 2.0 or 2.0.1) it is possible that
    the compilation of  =swakCodedFunctionObject= will fail. In that
    case remove the last parameter to the
    =codedFunctionObject=-constructor in =swakCodedFunctionObject.C=
    (it is clearly marked by a comment)
** Global installation
   If the libraries and utilities are considered stable and the should
   be available to everyone (without having to recompile them) the
   script =copySwakFilesToSite.sh= can be used to copy them to the
   global site-specific directories.

   The script =removeSwakFilesFromSite.sh= removes all these files
   from the global directories. The =removeSwakFilesFromLocal.sh= does
   the same for the user directories (this makes sure that no
   self-compiled version /shadows/ the global version (which would
   lead to strange results)

   There is a =Makefile= attached. =make install= compiles =swak4Foam=
   and installs it into the global directories

   *Note:* Due to the order in which library direcories are searched
   for with =-L= a global installation might break the compilation
** Packaging
*** Debian
    The command =build dpkg= builds a Debian/Ubuntu package for 
    the *currently enabled* OpenFOAM-package. Note:
    - it is assumed that the currently used OF-version was also
      installed by the package manager
    - the =dev= package is built but poorly maintained
    Changes in the packaging should be done in the branch
      =debianPackaging= of the Mercurial-repository

    *Note:* Due to the problem described with the global installation
    it might be necessary to deinstall a previously installed package
    to successfully build a new package
* Contents
** Libraries
   Collection of Libraries
*** =swak4FoamParsers=
    The basis of =swak4Foam=: the expression parsers with the logic to
    access the /OpenFOAM/ data-structures.

    None of the other software pieces compile without it.

    Also defines a subclass to =DataEntry= that uses
    =swak=-expressions and a function object =initSwakFunctionObject=
    that might be used if this fails
*** =simpleFunctionObjects=
    A collection of function objects that was previously separately
    available at
    http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_simpleFunctionObjects.

    Provides consistent output of values (on patches and fields) and
    more.
*** =groovyBC=
    Implements the infamous =groovyBC=. A boundary condition that
    allows arbitrary expressions in the field-file
*** =swakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects that have no additional requirements. Mainly used
    for manipulating and creating fields with expressions
    - addGlobalVariable :: Adds a variable to a global
         swak-namespace. Mainly used for debugging and resolving
         issues where a variable is needed in a BC before it is defined.
    - expressionField :: Create a new field from an expression
    - clearExpressionField :: Erase a field created with
         =expressionField=
    - manipulateField :: Modify a field in memory
    - createSampledSet :: Create a sampled set that can be used by
         other swak-entities (mainly boundary conditions)
    - createSampledSurface :: Create a sampled surface that can be used by
         other swak-entities (mainly boundary conditions)
    - swakCoded :: Child of the =coded=-functionObject that can read
                   and write global variables from and to
                   swak-namespaces

		   Assumes that the =SWAK4FOAM_SRC= environment
                   variable is set to the =Libraries=-directory of the
                   =swak4Foam=-sources 
    - solveLaplacianPDE :: Solve the Poisson equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho T}{\partial t} - \nabla \lambda \nabla T =
S_{expl} + S_{impl} T  
\end{equation}
         for $T$ where $\rho$, $\lambda$ and $S$ can be specified
    - solveTransportPDE :: Solve the transport equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho T}{\partial t} + \div(\phi,T) - \nabla \lambda \nabla T =
S_{expl} + S_{impl} T  
\end{equation}
         for $T$ where $\rho$, $\lambda$ and $S$ can be
         specified. Plus the name of the field $\phi$
*** =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=
    Function objects based on the =simpleFunctionObjects=-library
    (which is a prerequisite for compiling it).

    Evaluate expressions and output the results
*** =swakSourceFields=
    These classes allow to manipulate the solution. To use these the
    solver has to be modified.
    - expressionSource :: Field that is calculated from an
         expression. To be used as source-term or coefficient in some
         solver
    - forceEquation :: force an equation to fixed values in selected
                       locations. Has to be used after constructing
                       the equation and before solving
*** =swakTopoSources=
    =topoSources= for =cellSet= and =faceSet=. Can be used with the
    =cellSet= and =faceSet=-utilities 
*** =swakFiniteArea=
    Implements parsers for the =finiteArea=-stuff in 1.6-ext. Also
    implements =groovyBC= for =areaField= and =expressionField= and
    other function objects
*** =groovyStandardBCs=
    Collection of boundary conditions that give standard boundary
    conditions the possibility to use expression for the coefficients

    Contributions to this library are explicitly encouraged. Please
    use the Mercurial-branch =groovyStandardBCs= to /groovyify/
    standard boundary conditions.
*** =pythonIntegration=
    Embeds a =Python=-interpreter.

    - =pythonIntegrationFunctionObject= :: Executes =Python=-code
         at the usual execution times of functionObjects. The
         interpreter keeps its state

    This library is only compiled if the paths to the Python-Headers
    are configured in the =swakConfiguration=-file (see above)
*** =fluFunctionObjectDriver=
    Driver for =functionObjects= that implemented entirely in =Python=
    using the =pythonFlu=-library
** Utilities
*** =funkySetFields=
    Utility that allows creation and manipulation of files with
    expressions 
*** =funkySetAreaFields=
    Utility like =funkySetFields= for =areaFields= (only works with
    1.6-ext) 
*** =funkySetBoundaryField=
    Sets any field on a boundary to a non-uniform value based on an
    expression. 

    Acts without deeper understanding of the underlying boundary condition
*** =replayTransientBC=
    Utility to quickly test whether a groovyBC gives the expected
    results. Writes the specified fields with the applied boundary
    condition but doesn't do anything else.

    Can be used for other BCs as well
*** =funkyDoCalc=
    Evaluates expressions that are listed in a dictionary using data
    that is found on the disc and prints summarized data (min, max,
    average, sum) to the screen
** Examples
   If not otherwise noted cases are prepared by a simple
   =blockMesh=-call.

   *Note*: All the cases here are strictly for demonstration purposes and
   resemble nothing from the 'real world'

                       application: unphysical initial conditions
                       cause the run to fail during startup with
                       "normal" relaxation values)
**** =findPointPitzDaily=
     - Solver :: simpleFoam
     - Demonstrates :: Usage of the =pythonFlu=-integration to find

** =maintainanceScripts=
   Undocumented scripts used for maintaining =swak4Foam=. *If you
   don't understand them, don't use them*
* Bug reporting and Development
** Bug reports
   The preferred place for bug reports is
   http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/search.php?project_id=10&sticky_issues=on&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=90 
   
   A sourceforge-account is required for reporting
** Development
   Contributions to to =swak4Foam= are most welcome. If you want to
   contribute clone the Mercurial archive of the sources
: hg clone http://openfoam-extend.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/openfoam-extend/swak4Foam
   Change to the branch that you want to improve (usually =default=)
   and create a new branch
: hg branch <branchName>
   where =<branchname>= is an easily identifiable name that makes the
   purpose of the branch clear (for instance
   =bugfixWrongRandomFunction= or =featureHyperbolicFunctions=). Don't
   work on the =default= branch or any other branches that are not
   "yours". Such contributions will not be merged

   Once development on the branch is finished export the relevant
   changesets with 
: hg export <nodeID>
   (=nodeID= being the ids of "your" changesets) and send them to the
   maintainer (or attach them to a bug report on Manits). The changes
   will be reviewed and merged into the =default= branch (do not
   attempt to do this yourself). Patches generated with =hg export=
   make sure that all changes are attributed to the original developer
   (you).

   An alternative would be the =bundle= command. Just do
: hg bundle <bundlefile>
   and then send the =bundlefile=. This will include *all* commits
   that are not in the upstream repository and will allow similar
   inclusion in the upstream as =export=.

   Once you have proven by successfully submitting changesets via =hg
   export= you can ask for write access to the mercurial repository.
*** Suggest reading
    These topics may be "new" for the average OF-developer:
    - Mercurial :: A short tutorial on this can be found at
                   http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide/. If you already
                   know =git= the
                   http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/GitConcepts may
                   be enough for you
    - bison/flex :: This pair of compiler generator tools generate the
                    parsers for the expressions. Google for a tutorial
                    that looks promising to you.

		    For a short example that shows how a new function
		    was added to two parsers have a look at this
		    changeset that added the =cpu()=-function to the
		    field and the the patch-parser (usually you'll
		    have to write a new method for the driver too):
: hg diff -c 8604e865cce6
*** Special branches
    Currently the main branches are:
    - default :: The *main* branch. This is the brancht that the
                 general public will receive. It compiles under 1.7
                 and 1.6-ext
    - =port_2.0.x= :: The branch that compiles under OpenFOAM 2.0. This
                    will eventually become the =default=-branch
    - debianPackaging :: Branch for generating new Debian-packages of
         =swak4Foam=. If somebody wants to "inherit" this: contact the
         maintainer 
    - finiteArea :: In this branch the things for the
                    =finiteArea=-discretization (only present in
                    =1.6-ext=) is developed. Usually gets merged back
                    into the =default=-branch once a feature is completed
*** Distributed bug-tracking
    As an experimental feature distributed bug-tracking was introduced
    using the /Artemis/-extension for /Mercurial/ (see
    =http://hg.mrzv.org/Artemis/=). An up-to-date version can be
    installed by 
: hg clone http://hg.mrzv.org/Artemis/
    somewhere and installing the plugin by editing =.hgrc=.

    This is *not* the official bug-tracker for =swak4Foam=. It is used
    for keeping track of new features that are to be introduced to
    =swak4Foam= and may be discontinued if the experiment proves to be
    unsuccessful.

* Known bugs
  The following list is not complete. If the Artemis extension (see
  above) is installed then
: hg ilist
  gives a more up-to-date list
** Moving meshes and =sampledSurfaces= 
   It seems that with moving meshes =sampledSurfaces= don't get
   updated. This seems to be a problem with OpenFOAM itself (the
   regular =surfaces=-functionObject doesn't get updated. This is
   currently investigated
** Missing support for interpolation and point-Fields
   Apart from patches and internal fields the support for
   interpolation from cells to faces (and vice versa) is incomplete as
   well as point fields (although they are supported in the grammar)
** Caching of loaded fields not working
   This is especially evident for the =funkyDoCalc=-example
** Possible enhancements of the code
   Not really bugs, but stuff that bugs me
*** Pointers in the driver code
    This is necessary because of =bison=. Investigate possibilities to
    replace these by =tmp= and =autoPtr= 
** Possible memory loss
   =valgrind= reports some lost memory for stuff that is not directly
   allocated by =swak4Foam= (in OpenFOAM-sources)

   Will investigate. Relevant places are marked by comments in the
   code. Also the construction of =sampledSet= seems to loose memory
** Non-treatment of the inner product =&= of symmetric tensors
   Before OpenFOAM 2.1 the inner product of two symmetric tensors was
   a symmetric tensor. Since 2.1 it is a general tensor. As the
   general treatment in the grammar would be confusing currently the
   this product was removed from the grammar and therefor will not be
   correctly parsed
* History
** 2010-09-13
   First Release
** 2010-12-18
   New release
   Most important changes
*** Parser for =sampledSurfaces=
    Now expressions for the field on a sampled surface can be
    evaluated. All =sampledSurfaces= offered by OpenFOAM now can be
    used 
*** Multiline =variables=
    The =variables= entry (most notably used in =groovyBC= and
    =swakExpression=) now can be a list of strings. This allows some
    kind of "formatting" (one expression per line) and should improve
    readability
*** Two maintainance-scripts were added 
    These can copy the libraries and utilities to the global
    installation (for those who think that the swak4Foam-stuff is
    stable enough and want to 'bless' all users at their site with
    it). Note that any local installation still takes precedence
    (because =$FOAM_USER_APPBIN= is before =$FOAM_APPBIN= in the
    =$PATH= 
*** Parsers using 'external variables' are now run-time selectable
    This allows the inclusion of other parsers with the regular
    =swak4Foam= parsers and include them seamlessly with the
    =variables=-mechanism for 'externals' (in other words: you can add
    your own parser in a separate library without having to change
    anything about the overall =swak4Foam=, but it behaves as if it
    was part of it)
** 2011-01-30
*** Support for /Finite Area/-stuff
    Now there is support for the =finiteArea=-library found in
    1.6-dev. The support is found in a separate library
    =swakFiniteArea=. It has
    - a parser =faField= for =areaFields=
    - a parser =faPatch= for patches of =areaFields=
    - a variant of =groovyBC= for these patches
    - a computed source =faExpressionSource=
    - Function-object-variants for =areaFields=: =clearExpression=,
      =expressionField= and =manipulateField=. These work the same as
      their =volField=-counterparts
*** Bugfix for compiling in single precision
    See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=49
*** New function =nearDist=
    See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=44
** 2011-04-20
   New features and changes are (this list is not complete):
*** New utility =funkySetAreaField=
    Like =funkySetFields= for /finiteArea/. Also writes out a volume
    field for easier post-processing
*** Refactoring of =groovyBC= and groovified boundary conditions
    Makes it easier to use the =groovyBC=-machinery for other boundary
    conditions. Two standard boundary conditions were
    /groovified/. Others may follow
*** Easier deployment
    If no =simpleFunctionObjects= are present they can be downloaded
    by a script.
    Also scripts to handle global installations of =swak4Foam=
*** Force equations
    A class to force equations to certain values according to
    expressions
*** New utility =funkyDoCalc=
    Utility does calculations on saved results and outputs single
    numbers (min, max, sum, average) to the terminal. Can be used for
    reporting or validity checks
*** Debian packaging
    Crude packaging for Debian
*** Lookup-tables
    A single-argument function can be specified as a piecewise linear
    function. Basically works like timelines but the argument can be
    something else (not only the time)
*** Stored variables
    Variables that store their values between time-steps. Applications
    are statistics or switches
*** Sampled sets
    Sampled sets can now also be used as en entity on which
    calculation is possible.
** 2011-07-26
*** Port to OpenFOAM 2.0
    This is the first release that officially supports OpenFOAM 2.0
    
    Also it is the first release that incorporates the
    =simpleFunctionObjects=-library 
*** New features:
**** Rewrite of =rand= and =randNormal=
     - These two functions now can receive an integer seed that
       determines the pseudo-randooom sequence generated by  these functions
     - Two functions =randFixed= and =randNormalFixed= were
       added. While the usual =rand= functions generate a different
       result at every time-steps for these functions the pseudo-random
       sequence is determined *only* by the seed (not by the timestep)
**** Binary =min= and =max=
     Take the bigger/smaller of two fields. Helps avoid =?:=-operations
**** Allow writing of only volume-fields in =funkySetAreaFields=
     Application: If the results of the calculation are only needed in
     ParaView
**** Internal changes
     - Use =autoPtr= for sets
     - Update sets that change in memory or on disc
*** Bug-fixes
**** =funkySetAreaFields= did not check for the correct fields
     Fixed by Petr Vita
**** =surfaceProxy= uses the wrong geometric data
**** Avoid floating point exceptions with division of fields
     Calculated boundaries were $0$ and caused a division by zero
*** Packaging
**** Update Debian packaging
     - Packaging information for the currently used OF-version is
       generated (allows a separate =swak=-package for every OF-version
     - Submission to launchpad added
**** Deployment scripts
     Now install to =FOAM_SITE_APPBIN/LIBBIN=
** 2011-10-03
*** New features
**** =replayTransientBC= now supports multiple regions
     Uses the usual =-region=-option. Looks for a separate dictionary
     in the =system=-directory of that region
**** =replayTransientBC= allows execution of functionObjects
     This can be switched on using the =allowFunctionObjects=-option
**** =Python=-embedding
     Allows the execution of Python-Code in a functionObject

     This feature is still experimental and the organization of the
     libraries is subject to change
**** Global variables
     It is now possible to define variables that are 'global': They
     can be read in any entity. 

     Currently these variables can only be uniform.

     To access global variables the specification-dictionary has to
     have a =wordList= named =globalScopes=. The scopes are searched
     in that order for the names of global variables. Having scopes
     allows some kind of separation of the variables
**** Using OF 2.0 codeStreams
     Adds a functionObject =swakCoded= that extends the
     =coded=-functionObject to read and write global variables
**** Simplified boundary condition =groovyBCFixedValue=
     Added a boundary condition than allows to only fix the
     values. This should help to avoid problems with cases that don't
     like =mixed= (on which the regular =groovyBC= is based)
**** Function objects to solve PDEs
     Two function objects that solve /Partial Differential Equations/
     during a run have been added:
     - one that solves a laplacian (Poisson) equation
     - one that solves the transport equation for a scalar
     The relevant coefficients (including explicit and implicit source
     terms) can be specified using expressions
*** Administrative and packaging
**** Inject =swak4Foam= into a distro
     Added a script that takes the current sources, copies them into
     the appropriate places of a =OpenFOAM=-installation and slightly
     rewrites them to compile in this place. What happens then
     (committing them into the repository or just plain compilation)
     is up to the maintainer
**** Absorb =simpleFunctionObjects=
     As many parts of =swak4Foam= depend on it the
     =simpleFunctionObjects= have now been absorbed into
     =swak4Foam=. They can still be compiled on their own
*** Bugfixes
**** Variables not working for parallel computations
     If a variable is defined and the patch which it is defined on
     doesn't have any faces the variable is reported on that processor
     as /not existing/ and the whole run fails
** 2012-01-04
*** Cases changed
**** =circulatingSplash=
     Fixed according to a suggestion by Andreas Otto. Now runs again
     (used to crash some time-steps into the beginning)
*** Infrastructure
**** Check for correct =bison=-version
     The =Allwmake=-script now checks for the correct bison-version
     (and the existence of =bison=) and fails if it doesn't seem to be
     the right one
**** Supply a header with preprocessor-symbols about the used OF-version
     To allow distinguishing different OF-versions as discussed in the
     bug report
     [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=114]]
     the =Allwmake=-script now generates a header file
     =foamVersion4swak.H= that defines the symbols
     =FOAM_VERSION4SWAK_MAJOR=, =FOAM_VERSION4SWAK_MINOR= and
     =FOAM_VERSION4SWAK_PATCH= 
*** Technical
**** Refactoring of the FieldDriver
     - now can also produce surfaceFields
     - full support of =tensor=, =symmTensor= and =sphericalTensor=
**** Refactoring of the FaFieldDriver
     - now can also produce edgeFields
     No support for tensors yet
**** Writing of =storedVariables=
     If necessary (for instance =swakExpression=-functionObject) the
     =storedVariables= are written to disc (into a subdirectory
     =swak4Foam= of the timestep) and are reread at the start. This
     allows consistent restarts (for instance if a flow was summed
     using the variable) *if the expressions stay the same*.
**** =simpleFunctionObjects= now write vectors and tensors without brackets
     Data files can now be written without brackets but each component on
     its own. The number of entries in the header is not adjusted
**** A /default mesh/ for the drivers exists
     For drivers that don't have access to a =fvMesh= a default mesh
     exists. This default mesh is defined by the first =fvMesh= that
     is used during the construction of *any* driver.

     Definition of the default mesh can be forced using the
     =initSwakFunctionObject= (see the test case =flowRateAngledDuct=)
*** New features
**** General =phi= in =solveTransportPDE=
     Due to the refactoring of the =FieldDriver= now =phi= can be
     specified by a general expression (instead of 'only' a
     field-name) 
**** =funkySetFields= now also writes surfaceFields
     Can write =surfaceVector= and =surfaceScalar=-Fields. Condition
     has to be consistent
**** Function objects now =surfaceField=-aware
     =expressionField= and =manipulateField= now can create or modify
     =surfaceFields= 
**** =funkySetFields= and function objects support tensors
     =funkySetFields= and the function objects =expressionField= and
     =manipulateField=  now also work with the three tensor-types
**** Extension of the =expressionToFace= =topoSet=
     If the expression evaluates to a =surfaceField= then this is used
     as a flag whether or not the face is in the =faceSet=. If the
     expression evaluates to a =volScalarField= then the old semantic
     applies (faces are in the set if one cell is =true= and the other
     is =false=).
     
     This only works for internal faces
**** =addGlobalVariable= allows setting more than one value
     If there is an entry =globalVariables= then this dictionary is
     used to set the variables
**** Function object =calculateGlobalVariables=
     Calculates variables and then pushes them to a global namespace
**** Generate a dummy =phi= in =replayTransientBC=
     New option added that generates a =phi= field with value $0$ to
     keep boundary conditions like =inletOutlet= happy
**** Function object to dump expression results
     The functionObject =dumpSwakExpression= dumps the complete
     results of a swakExpression to file at each timestep. This
     produces huge files and is therefor not endorsed
**** Additional options for =funkySetFields=
     Add the options =allowFunctionObjects= and =addDummyPhi= to
     execute functionObjects and add a =phi=-field (for fields that
     require these)
**** Boundary condition =groovcBCDirection=
     Based on the =directionMixed= boundary condition this allows to
     set a boundary condition as a Dirichlet-condition only in certain
     directions while in the other directions it is a
     gradient-condition
**** Boundary condition =groovyBCJump=
     Boundary condition that imposes a jump in the value on a cyclic
     boundary condition pair (based on =jumpCyclic=). Only works for
     scalar values
**** =simpleFunctionObjects= write CSV-files
     Setting the option =outputFileMode= to =csv= writes
     CSV-files. The option-value =foam= is the default (old style). The
     option-value =raw= writes the values delimited by spaces (no
     brackets for vectors and tensors)
**** Submeshes automatically read if =searchOnDisc= specified
     If a submesh is not yet in memory and the option =searchOnDisc=
     is set, the mesh is automatically read into memory and kept there
**** Conditional =functionObjects=
     The =simpleFunctionObjects=-library now has a number of
     functionObjects that allow the conditional execution of a list of
     function objects.

     These are
     - executeIfExecutableFits :: if the name of the executable fits a
          regular expression the function objects are executed
     - executeIfObjectExists :: if a named object exists (or
          alternatively: doesn't exist) in the registry execute the
          function objects. Type checking also implemented
     - executeIfEnvironmentVariable :: execute if an environment
          variable satisfies a certain condition (exists, doesn't
          exist, fits a regular expression)
     - executeIfFunctionObjectPresent :: execute if a specific
          functionObject is present. This can help prevent failures if
          a functionObject is missing for technical reasons
     In addition the =simpleSwakFunctionObjects=-library has
     - executeIfSwakObject :: Evaluates a logical swak-expression. The
          results are either accumulated using logical /or/ (if *one*
          value is true the result will be true) or logical /and/ (all
          values have to be true)
     The =pythonIntegration=-library has
     - executeIfPython :: Evaluates a Python-code-snipplet that
          returns a value. If this value is "true" in Pythons
          standards then the functionObjects are executed
**** =functionObject= that reads gravitation
     =simpleFunctionObjects= has an additional function object that
     reads the direction of gravitation. The purpose is to assist
     boundary conditions like =buoyantPressure= that rely on it to
     work. Best used together with conditional function objects ("If
     =g= is missing ....")
**** PDE-functionObjects for =finiteArea=
     Solve transport and laplacian equation
**** Subclass to =DataEntry= that uses /swak/-expressions
     This is defined in the =swak4FoamParsers=-library. The class
     needs a default mesh defined to construct the driver. Definition
     of the default mesh (if no other driver was constructed in some
     function-object or by a =groovyBC=) can be forced using the
     =initSwakFunctionObject= (see the test case =flowRateAngledDuct=)
**** =funkySetAreaField= now also writes edgeFields
     Similar to the =surfaceFields= in =funkySetFields=
*** Bug fixes
**** Compilation with Intel-Compiler possible
     The =Utilities= failed with the Intel-compiler. Compilation now
     falls back to good old =g++=
**** Access to tensor-components not working
     Because the tokens were not defined in the =flex=-files getting
     tensor components with =tensor.xx= did not work. Fixed
**** Constants for surfaceFields not working
     Because surfaceFields know no =zeroGradient= the template
     =makeConstant= did not work
**** =snGrad= does not work for patches if the file is on disc
     Change so that the field gets temporarily loaded to calculate the
     gradient on the patch. Same for =internalField= and
     =neighbourField=
**** =potentialFoam= does not correctly use a =groovyBC=
     The reason is that =groovyBC= usually doesn't get evaluated
     during construction. The reason is that it is hard to tell
     whether all required fields are already in memory. The current
     fix is a workaround: setting =evaluateDuringConstruction= to
     =true= forces the BC to be evaluated during construction
**** Extra evaluation of boundary conditions causes failure
     Extra evaluation of boundary condition that should fix the
     problem with =calculated= patches causes =funkySetFields= to fail
     with stock boundary conditions if not all fields are present in
     memory 
*** Discontinued features
**** =groovyFlowRateInletVelocity=
     This boundary condition will be removed in future releases
     because the base class now supports the more general
     =DataEntry=-class for which a =swak=-subclass exists
** Next release
